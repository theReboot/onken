## What do we mean by "media"?

The "media" is never a homogenous category. As a broad landscape assessment, this report will not discuss granular differences between media outlets. But we will distinguish between establishment media organizations, which in Kenya are too entangled politically to be independent and which control national, regional, and local print, radio, television, and digital outlets, from independent media organizations, which are largely non-existent in Kenya, aside from a few individual journalists and smaller organizations and which are in critical need of the financial and technical support to remain independent.
