## 1. International Learning Networks

### Fellowships or other learning experiences for Kenyan journalists to learn from international alternative media companies

#### Influence and Opportunity Description

-   Independent journalists are dependent on big media organizations to pay for and publish stories

-   Use fellowship or other modality to strengthen relationship with independent kenyan journalists to create opportunities for other places to publish

-   Freeing them from dependence on paid work from the big kenyan media countries

-   Expose independent journalists to international standards for media to try to show alternative model than pay to play journalism

-   There are already a number of fellowship Â programs around the world

-   Work could be distributed on international platforms (think Netflix, HBO, NewsDeeply, Vice etc) while also being demanded by kenyans. (many kenyan elites use these international platforms).

#### Impact

-   This could be transformative for aspiring independent journalists, to connect with larger organizations outside of Kenya

-   It could also provide an important publisher for stories that cannot or won't be published by Kenyan media

-   Provide political cover and credibility to independent journalists

-   Provide access to competitive payment/reporting for independent journalists

-   However, likely only reach a small number of people

#### Level of Effort

-   There would be quite a lot of work involved with building the relationships, defining the program, and the criteria

-   Would need to find a way to make it in the interest of the media organizations

#### Other Considerations/Risk
