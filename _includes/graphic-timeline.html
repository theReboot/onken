        <p>With the series of reforms, the state provides funding for the Media Council of Kenya—absorbing some of its role. Two new regulatory bodies are also established within government, meaning there are three bodies, with overlapping functions, in charge of regulating the industry and with the power to impose large fines on media houses or individuals.</p>
        <p>The reforms’ positive effect of streamlined media governance is largely undercut by the journalist intimidation to which the new regulatory bodies contribute.</p>
