### Citizens Advocate for Their Town

Thika is a medium-sized town outside of Nairobi, which attracts little media attention. A citizen-run blog, [Thika Town Today](http://www.thikatowntoday.co.ke/), was founded to fill this gap; despite capacity constraints, the blog is beginning to open new lines of effective communication from citizens to their government.

Founded by one citizen, the blog now has a staff of two. It covers local news, including issues with governance and service delivery, and claims that its mission is to serve the people. Its website lists "No inclination to any race, tribe, religion, or political affiliation" as one of its core values.

The site struggles to get access to government officials, even for standard briefings or to answer questions. The best way to get government attention, one respondent told us, is through a complaint: "If the town doesn't have water for a day, a week, a couple weeks, you write about it online and the county will contact you directly."

Researchers also heard that this is beginning to create a positive feedback loop for local citizens. For example, people who are harassed by the police can report it to Thika Town Today, who post it on the site. This makes people feel heard, making citizens feel stronger in their relationship to government. Its success, while still limited, suggests that local-level media efforts are ripe for experimentation and investment.
