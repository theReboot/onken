## Theory of Change

We see media as one pillar of the "accountability ecosystem." Media is only as strong as civil society and citizens---transparency only leads to accountability when it's paired with voting, advocacy, civic dialogue, legal challenges.

-   Transparency does not necessarily lead to accountability. Media's job is to shine lights, raise issues, and educate. It is up to the public and civil society---ideally, working in concert with the media---to pressure government and demand accountability.

-   If the other institutions of governance are weak, like the ability to prosecute corruption, or to ensure government upholds its responsibilities laid out the constitution, then government will not be responsive to the public, no matter how free and fair the press is. (However: A free and fair press depends on the strength of these other institutions)

-   While this research focuses specifically on the strength of the media (i.e., we did not examine the other institutions, such as the judiciary), it analyzes the media within the context of the holistic institutional system.

-   Strengthening the media for good governance means working within the larger system. Donors need to understand and coordinate media, civil society, citizens (and where possible---government actors, too)
