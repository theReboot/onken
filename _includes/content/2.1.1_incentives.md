### Pressures and incentives on media

The effort to stifle media criticism was described by many respondents as both intentional and strategic. The government has made a multi-pronged attack on press freedom, using almost every available tool to weaken the press, including both extreme methods of violence and intimidation to the more-subtle-but-no-less-powerful tools of economic and political pressure, as well as legal and judicial attacks. We will look at each of these in detail:

#### Violence and intimidation

-   Human Rights Watch has documented XX instances of journalist intimidation, including XX murders of journalists.

-   Politicians will pay for "moles" in newsrooms to give them information about who specifically published critical articles.

#### Political pressure

Ownership of local media is perhaps the most glaring and widely cited flaw in Kenya's media landscape. All of the major media houses in Kenya have significant political ties. Those that are not directly owned by a politician, or by someone affiliated with a political party, have clear commercial interests that depend on the good graces of politicians.

-   The Standard, for example, is owned by the Moi family, which has a clear stake in all political reporting, need description here.

-   The Nation, on the other hand, is owned by Aga Kahn, need description here; Kahn's commercial interests make him sensitive to political issues, as his business success depends on politicians' good graces.

Owners yield explicit and implicit influence over press coverage, creating a culture of self-censorship and delicate coverage.

-   The government is also reportedly not shy about forcing these politically connected media outlets to fire "troublesome" journalists and editors who publish unfavorable articles.

-   A number of high profile firings have taken place, many attributing to offending ownership of the company. Oft cited examples:

-   Denis Galva need details

-   Gado - need details

#### Economic pressure

Financial considerations are a challenge for media all over the world; in Kenya, the government has made a concerted effort to undermine media's financial stability, which has had a strong cooling effect on the traditional media ecosystem.

As in other countries, traditional media houses in Kenya are fully dependent on advertising revenue (as newspaper circulation revenue has taken a large hit as people have turned online).

-   The government has historically been one of the two main sources of advertising revenue in Kenya (with corporate clients being the other).

-   The government has nearly ceased advertising, which has had a major economic impact on the media. This seems to have been a conscious choice in order to hurt the media.

-   The government has pulled almost all of its advertising from traditional media, centralized all ads purchasing through a single agency, the Government Advertising Agency. What year did this happen? The government also created its own ad publication, MyGov, which is both an online web portal and an insert found in published newspapers. This has proven to be an effective strategy for the government to undermine the financial stability of traditional media, while eliminating its dependence on the media to communicate with the public.

-   A few respondents noted that the arrangements by which MyGov is included in daily publications appears to be a secretive agreement.

-   In some cases, the government is also failing to pay for ads that have already run; The government reportedly owes the Nation and the Standards millions of dollars in unpaid ad debts

-   The result has been a decline in government ad revenue of XXXX, costing thousands of newsroom jobs.

-   Side Note: The practice of censorship-through-advertising has extended to corporate advertisers as well; a number of respondents noted that corporate interests are not shy about threatening to withdraw advertising if unfavorable coverage is published or broadcast.

Having undermined the revenue at the field level, the government is also taking advantage of individual journalists who are in economically precarious positions:

-   The government hires away good journalists into its communications shops

-   Or pays journalists and editors to omit stories and give favorable coverage.

-   Need example here.  

#### Legal pressure

While the Kenyan constitution protects freedom of the press, respondents noted that the government is successfully manipulating the legal and regulatory environment to intimidate and silence journalists.

-   For example, the Media Council of Kenya (established in XXLaw) is meant to serve an independent oversight role, including Xquick description of duties, etcXX.

-   However, although some programmatic funding comes from donors like XX and XX, the Council is dependent on the government for its core funding---which the government has withheld since  year.

-   The government has simultaneously attempted to co-opt the Council's mandate by moving specific functions into the purview of other agencies, which are completely government-controlled, such as XX and XX. To insert some concrete outcomes of this shift.

-   The government has also pursued legal action against critical journalists by suing for libel. A number of respondents, however, noted at least partial confidence in the independence of the courts. One respondent noted that it really depends on individual judges. Nevertheless, some of these libel awards can be devastating for media houses and, more importantly, for independent journalists. Possible example: Journalists joke that their only trainings on the job are "how not to get sued for libel."

[BOX]  Social media as a tool to undermine the press

-   The government has become adept at using social media to manipulate perceptions.

-   The government also reportedly considers itself a "digital government", and have employed strategies to manipulate online perceptions

-   In addition to actually using social media for self-promotion, a number of respondents reported that bloggers were paid to produce favorable content, troll adversaries, and traffic in rumor and fake news

-   One prominent blogger, Robert Ailes, once a critic of the government, has been accused of taking money from the government in return for favorable coverage

-   Note about Kenyatta's partnership with Cambridge Analytics -- to investigate?
