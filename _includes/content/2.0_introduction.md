# The Accountability Ecosystem in Kenya Today

{% include figure.html class="floatLeft" src="/assets/img/on_graphic_intro.png" %}

Understanding the current Kenyan media landscape requires looking at each of the main constituents that interact with the media and affect its public interest work: **Government**, **Citizens**, and **Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)**. Interactions between the media and these constituents create **"pressures and incentives,"** which influence the media's ability to provide independent, unbiased information of public interest. Some of these, referred to as **"coping strategies,"** lead to the kind of robust, critical, and strategic journalism that most effectively drives accountability. But many lead in the opposite direction. To evaluate coping mechanisms' effect on media's ability to be free and fair, we have visually assessed each using a Free and Fair Index.

In the first section, we talk a high-level view of the **Media** itself. We then explore the constraints created by the other three constituents---**Government**, **Citizens**, and **CSOs**---in more detail.

Readers will gain a systems-level view of the current media ecosystem. This will help those working in and around media understand their own position as constituents of the media ecosystem themselves, whose interventions create incentives and inspire coping mechanisms. By understanding current dynamics and constraints, supporters will be better able to target their interventions to complement positive coping mechanisms, counter negative ones, and pinpoint the most effective places to adjust the entire system toward greater accountability.
