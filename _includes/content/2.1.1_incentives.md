### How government pressures and incentivizes media

In its multi-pronged attack on press freedom, the Kenyatta administration has taken advantage of almost every available tool to weaken the media---including extreme methods of violence and intimidation.[](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/30/not-worth-risk/threats-free-expression-ahead-kenyas-2017-elections)

[Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/30/not-worth-risk/threats-free-expression-ahead-kenyas-2017-elections) and Article 19 have documented 17 instances of journalist intimidation between 2013 and 2017, including 2 alleged  murders of journalists. While these are worrying trends, outright violence is not as common as the more-subtle (but no less powerful) tools of economic and political pressure, as well as legal and regulatory attacks on press: Â 

#### Political pressure

The most glaring flaw in Kenya's media landscape is the deep web of political connections amongst owners of all of the media organizations. Every major media house in Kenya is owned by either a politician, a close party affiliate, or a business person with other commercial interests that depend on politicians' good graces. The Standard, for example, is owned by the Moi family, and The Nation is owned by the Aga Kahn, the royal head of an Islamic denomination and a business magnate whose complex commercial entanglements necessitate political sensitivities.

Owners wield immense influence over coverage, and over journalists' and editors' careers. This influence is often explicit, as politicians work their connections to have "troublesome" journalists and editors fired. Respondents also reported a widespread sense of insecurity as a journalist; one noted that politicians often pay "moles" working in newsrooms to report on which editors and/or journalists are specifically publishing critical articles. Several recent, high-profile firings were frequently cited by respondents as evidence of the danger of rocking the boat: Need examples, here, including Denis Galva and Gado.

#### Economic pressure

Every media organization in the world struggles with revenue, but the Kenyan media in recent years has faced an unusually effective government-driven campaign to undermine fiscal stability.

The government has historically been one of the main sources of ad revenue in the country (corporations, primarily banks and telecoms, are the other). But in 2015, the government consolidated all of its advertising into a single platform, called "MyGov," a primarily digital channel with a monthly newspaper insert. Simultaneously, it created the Government Advertising Agency, transforming the media's largest source of ad revenue from a diversified portfolio of multiple agency partnerships into a single source.

This consolidation has effectively kneecapped the revenue streams for establishment media houses, while also freeing the government from reliance on the media to communicate with the public. The government now uses advertising revenue as bait, pushing media institutions into uncritical support of its agenda (with which media organizations are largely complicit). A few respondents noted that the arrangements by which MyGov is included in daily publications appears to be a secretive agreement. In some cases, the government is also failing to pay for ads that have already run (including reports that The Nation and The Standard are both due millions of dollars in unpaid ads).

The result has been a decline in government ad revenue of XXXX, costing thousands of newsroom jobs. The political influence of advertising dollars has also extended to corporate advertisers, including banks and telecoms; a number of respondents noted that corporate interests are not shy about threatening to withdraw advertising if unfavorable coverage is published or broadcast.

#### Legal pressure

While the Kenyan constitution protects freedom of the press, respondents noted that the government is successfully manipulating the legal and regulatory environment to intimidate and silence journalists.

The government has also muddied freedom of the press at the regulatory level by creating three, competing agencies that have the power to regulate and fine media actors. The Media Council of Kenya, established by the Media Act of 2007, was originally meant to serve an independent oversight role, setting industry standards like journalist accreditation. As the Council is primarily government-funded, respondents reported that its power is limited, and the government has withheld funding from the Media Council since YEAR?. Simultaneously, it has transferred several of the agency's functions to other, completely government-controlled agencies. The Multimedia Tribunal, for example, is part of the CA; one respondent noted that many politicians are able to bring complaints about journalist ethics to the Tribunal, which has the power to deliver settlements to the plaintiff, sidestepping the Council (which can only impose fines, which are much lower).

Legal action is thus another strategy for press attacks. Fortunately, there is general faith in the independence of the courts; one respondent noted that the outcome of a case likely depends on an individual judge. While libel suits are not a fail-safe tactic for government censors, libel awards can be devastating, especially for independent journalists. And the threat of lawsuit seems to be a common excuse for media houses; one respondent joked that the only training journalists receive on the job is "how not to get sued."
