# Why Foster Kenyan Independent Media?

Kenya's establishment media is frequently cited as the strongest in East Africa (a reputation demonstrated by headlines in [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7171372.stm) and the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/03/terrorism-westgate-mall-press-freedom)). But this reputation stands in contrast to the lived experiences of journalists and editors, who are weighed down by political and commercial conflicts of interest and an antagonistic government. These conflicts have weakened the fourth estate, leaving Kenya without an independent media to inform citizens, drive public conversations, and fulfill the essential role of government watchdog. Supporters of a free and independent press can play a role in addressing this gap, by helping courageous journalists overcome the systemic barriers they face in Kenya today. Â 

#### The Weakening of the Kenyan Media

Despite evidence that Kenya's media frequently falls short of unbiased, rigorous journalism, many respondents lamented the decline in financing for independent media in recent years. This decline has resulted in downsized programs, staff lay-offs, and closed capacity development initiatives.

The decline has come at a time when supporters of media and civil society are urgently needed. Since first taking power in 2013, the administration of President Uhuru Kenyatta has antagonized the press and assaulted press freedom in intentional and strategic ways---pulling ad revenue, paying bribes, and intimidating journalists and editors. Attacks on the press are not new to Kenyans, but this downward shift has stood in contrast to the optimism inspired by the explicit protections for freedoms of press and expression in the 2010 Constitution. Our goal in this report is to draw attention to this troubling trend while offering analysis and recommendations to help media entrepreneurs, donors, and other stakeholders understand the systematic forces at play and apply strategic approaches to bolster independent media.
