### 2. Hosting Alternative Media Labs

### Dedicated spaces for experimenting with creative storytelling and novel partnerships could tap into new ways of engaging audiences (and would inspire journalists and media entrepreneurs).

#### Opportunity

In the face of government pressure, journalists need creative ways to capture audience attention with compelling narratives. Media supporters could sow the seeds of long-term impact by creating a space for media actors to experiment and prototype new models of storytelling---especially alongside filmmakers, artists, social media experts, technologists, and other cross-disciplinary collaborators. A "media lab," in the model of Nieman Lab or MIT Civic Media Lab in the U.S., could spark exciting new ventures in Kenya, and help surface promising journalists and other media entrepreneurs. The exact focus and mission, as well as where such a lab may be situated---within a university, or as an independent institution---should be driven by the Kenyan media professionals who would lead such a venture.

Boosting independent media will require bold new models to engage and activate audiences. Creating a space for incubation could nurture the kinds of alternative media ventures that could reinvigorate Kenyans' trust in media. We envision an investment in this kind of lab would require multi-year support, beyond the more typical one- to two-year grants media organizations receive. This would help encourage long-term thinking on potential models for independent journalism.
