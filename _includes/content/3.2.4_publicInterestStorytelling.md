### 4. Public Interest Storytelling Â 

### Funding commercially driven content grounded in social impact---such as news series, documentaries, comedy, and satire---can meet consumer demand while informing audiences.

#### Opportunity

Much of Kenyan entertainment media has historically been shipped in from international audiences. However, a[ new law now requires 40 percent of content](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000187819/kenyan-broadcasters-have-till-june-to-comply-with-law-on-local-content-law) to be produced locally, which is creating incentives for media outlets. Supporters can take advantage of this moment by backing independent journalists to create new forms of public interest content in new mediums. Stories that emotionally cover the nuances of the Kenyan experience (rather than more straightforward news), and/or that embed meaningful information in entertainment, can tap into new streams of audience demand.

#### Impact

Successful public interest content in the entertainment media model can provide new business and career opportunities for talented journalists. A well-produced piece could demonstrate the business viability of such content, encouraging other actors to experiment.
