## What do we mean by "media"?

The "media" is never a homogenous category. As a broad landscape assessment, this report will not discuss granular differences between media outlets. But we will distinguish between establishment media organizations, which in Kenya are too entangled politically for donor intervention, and independent media, which in Kenya is largely non-existent, aside from a few individual journalists and smaller organizations, and which is in critical need of donor intervention.
