## Theory of Change

Democracy and good governance depend on an independent media that is capable, experienced, and trusted. But the work of the media---shining lights, raising issues, and educating the public---does not automatically lead to good governance. It is up to citizens to pressure government and demand accountability; media is most successful when it understands, amplifies, and collaborates with citizens through its work, a dynamic described in [Reboot's report on the West Africa media](http://westafricamedia.reboot.org/).

That's why Reboot advocates a systems approach to media development. We see media as one constituent of the "accountability ecosystem," along with civil society, government actors, international donors, the justice system, and citizens themselves.

As in any ecosystem, the strength and health of each constituent in the accountability ecosystem depends on the others. If the other constituents are weak---for example, if citizens do not trust voting results---then the government will be less responsive to public pressure, no matter how free and fair the press is (and the press in a lopsided system is much less likely to be free and fair).

In a well-functioning accountability ecosystem, the media is both a watchdog and a megaphone, spotlighting malfeasance as well as amplifying the voices of citizens and civil society. The effectiveness of media ultimately depends on others; voting, advocacy, civic dialogue, legal challenges, and other forces are necessary to bring the media's work of transparency through to true accountability.

Thus, strengthening the work of media for good governance requires working strategically within the accountability ecosystem. Media development work will naturally focus on media actors (and building up every constituent of the accountability ecosystem simultaneously is unfeasible). But donors need to understand and coordinate media, civil society, citizens, and even government actors where possible. This is the only way to accurately evaluate opportunities for intervention.
