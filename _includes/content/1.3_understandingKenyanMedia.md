#### The deep influence of tribalism

Tribal alliances are a powerful and divisive force in Kenya, and one that has frequently been manipulated by Kenya’s governing elite. Elections are often decided along ethnic lines, and politicians at every level of government in Kenya have used tribal bias and allegiance as an integral tool in a patronage politics system. Just as ethnic and tribal identity are woven into Kenyan society and politics, these divisions are an intrinsic factor in Kenya’s media, both in reporting and audience interpretation.

Because political and ethnic allegiance are closely intertwined, political influence over establishment media houses includes tribal bias. Owners tend to hire key editorial managers from their own ethnic groups, and tend to encourage a general editorial policy focused on strengthening and promoting the collective sense of belonging to an ethno-political block. Similarly, the public’s trust in a media outlet is often tied to the outlet’s perceived ethno-national agenda.  

Tribalism touches every aspect of life in Kenya; while this research does not deeply explore tribalism, all findings should be interpreted in the context of this pervasive influence.
