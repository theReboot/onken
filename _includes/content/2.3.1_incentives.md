### How citizens pressure and incentivize media

  <p>Kenyans may trust the media more than they trust the government, but this is a very low bar.</p>

Every respondent we spoke with expressed some level of frustration with the media---a finding consistent with research by Afrobarometer showing only 39 percent of Kenyans "[trust the media a lot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6ORDgrjEYhdC1wTXlGeFlwSWM/view?usp=sharing)."

#### Low trust in media

Respondents were aware of the political motivations of the owners of establishment media organizations (see [Constituent 2](#government)), and see that it influences coverage; this is a key driver of mistrust.

#### Triangulating information from multiple platforms

As a result of this distrust, citizens rely on multiple sources of media for information. Kenyans triangulate information through multiple outlets, and complement it with information provided to them through both in-person and online social networks. WhatsApp was one of the most important sources of information for many respondents, who overwhelmingly receive (and share) articles and discussed news via the messaging platform.

#### Relying on social media

Internet usage estimates vary considerably in Kenya, from 67 to 90 percent, depending on the source. Social media use remains considerably lower across the country as a whole; recent figures suggest there are about [7 million Facebook users](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-election-facebook/facebook-offers-tool-to-combat-fake-news-in-kenya-ahead-of-polls-idUSKBN1AK1IU), [10 million](https://ifree.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/State-of-Internet-Report-Kenya-2016.pdf) Whatsapp users, and [2 million](https://ifree.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/State-of-Internet-Report-Kenya-2016.pdf) Twitter users. Nevertheless, in Nairobi, [where social media usage is most concentrated](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2017/09/04/the-tyranny-of-numbers-on-social-media-during-kenyas-2017-elections/), Facebook, Whatsapp, and Twitter are extremely important channels for accessing and triangulating information.

Many respondents expressed understanding of the potential for misinformation online, a finding backed by [polling data](http://blog.geopoll.com/geopoll-and-portland-launch-a-survey-report-on-fake-news-in-kenya). On one hand, some users believe that online conversations are fast, diverse, and resilient enough to challenge rumor, and surface the truth. However, others expressed the opposite opinion, calling Kenyans "uncritical," too quick to share news without evaluating it. There is truth to both statements: social media is valuable in spreading news and driving media innovation, but the risks of rumor mongering and manipulation are still real.
