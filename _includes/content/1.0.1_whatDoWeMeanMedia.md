### What do we mean by "media"?

As a broad landscape assessment, this report will not discuss granular differences between types of media outlets. But we will distinguish between **establishment media organizations**, which are well-established, large companies controlling national, regional, and local print, radio, television, and digital outlets, from **independent media organizations**, which do not have the same structural and political entanglements that affect their independence, and which are in critical need of financial and technical support to remain independent.
