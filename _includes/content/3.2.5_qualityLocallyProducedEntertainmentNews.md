#### Influence

-   Much of kenyan media is shipped in from international audiences.

-   New law saying 40% of kenyan content needs to be local.

-   Establishment media has a weak link with its audience

-   Audience is demanding more creative content

#### Opportunity Description

-   Work with independent journalists to create content for a variety of mediums that is meaningful for a variety of kenyan audiences.

#### Impact

#### Grant journalists who successfully produce content credibility, larger audience, access to future funds, and networks

-   But successful content will likely be few and far between, unsustained

-   Possible for a well produced piece to be a game changer though

#### Level of Effort

-   Depends on how many organizations, types of stories

-   But could be prototyped fairly easily

-   Provide international contacts, financial support, and alternative distributors, therefore reducing reliance on traditional media

#### Other Considerations

-   Will need to balance whether the intended audience is completely international, or whether they intend content to have an impact in Kenya - This consideration is very important
