# Opportunities

Supporting independent media in Kenya today will require helping journalists, publishers, and media entrepreneurs overcome the political and economic pressures that limit their ability to report freely. This means providing financing to free them from the dependence on commercial advertising while they work to identify new business models. It means helping journalists become financially secure to insulate them from pay-to-play journalism. It means helping to professionalize reporting through well-designed training and mentorship. It also means working to insulate journalists from political influence by helping to build a strong collective voice among themselves, and with civil society, to stand up to government challenges.

Below, we have identified a portfolio of opportunities---both creative new ideas and adjustments to more traditional media development approaches---to support and strengthen independent media.
