# The Accountability Ecosystem in Kenya Today

Understanding the current Kenyan media landscape requires first looking at each of the main constituents that interact with the media and its work for transparency and accountability: Government, Citizens, and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).

This page focuses on each of these constituents in turn, exploring the "pressures and incentives" they create for media actors. The media's current practices and outputs are largely in response to these pressures and incentives; some of these "coping strategies" lead to the kind of robust, critical, and strategic journalism that most effectively drives accountability, but most lead in the opposite direction. To evaluate coping mechanisms' effect on media's ability to be free and fair, we have visually assessed each using a Free and Fair Index.

In the final section of this page, we turn to the Media itself, building on all previous findings. Following the same framework, we explore the constraints created by the industry itself: The pressures and incentives media actors experience due to the structure and culture of the field, as well as the strategies that individual journalists and editors use to cope.

Readers will gain a systems-level view of the current media ecosystem. This will help those working in and around media--understand their own position---as constituents of the media ecosystem themselves---whose interventions create further pressures and incentives and inspire coping mechanisms. By understanding current dynamics and constraints, donors will be better able to target their investments to complement positive coping mechanisms, counter negative ones, and pinpoint the most effective places to adjust the entire system toward greater accountability.
