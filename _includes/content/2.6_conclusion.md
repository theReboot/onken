## Conclusion

Right now, Kenya is ripe for a new era of investment in independent media---one that is more strategic, and which takes into account the entire ecosystem of actors that influence media's work. The high appetite amongst Kenyan citizens for trustworthy, rigorous journalism is an exciting opportunity for investors to tap into new markets; the high number of newly independent journalists looking to publish their work is an exciting opportunity to support rigorous new talent. Combined with the age of digital media, the current moment holds high potential.  

In seizing these opportunities, supporters must be aware of the challenges that remain. Freedom of the press faces government opposition, and old media business models have political entanglements that limit independence. New investments must address these challenges head-on, in part by working to strengthen media's best allies: civil society and the citizenship at large. By building trust between media, CSOs, and the audience, supporters of independent media can unlock new strengths for the fourth estate.  

In the following section, we offer a few signposts on the way to this lofty goal.
