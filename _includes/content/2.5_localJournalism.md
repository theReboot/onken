The 2010 constitution created a system of devolved government in Kenya, reallocating many of the country's resources to the local level---and creating important local power centers. Such a distributed power structure requires a strong local media for accountability. But Kenya's local media today is not robust enough to provide appropriate oversight for local government, which is responsible for health care, pre-primary education, local road maintenance, and other vital public services.

Even though our research focused on urban and peri-urban areas (particularly Nairobi), the importance of good local media emerged as a central theme, and many respondents lamented Kenya's lack in the area. Given the dramatically different scenarios that exist across the country and especially in rural areas, additional research is needed to fully understand the constraints and opportunities for media at the local level.

In hopes of encouraging and supporting that necessary research, here we share some of the key themes about Kenyan media at the local level that we surfaced, and which can guide further explorations:
