### 7. Understanding Audiences

### Funding studies about audiences, specifically on different regional contexts and younger demographics will help journalists better reach the next generation of audiences.

#### Opportunity

Understanding audiences---and targeting to them---is a foundational skill for any journalist. Despite investments in audience research, there still seems to be a gap between what audiences want, and what they get. This is exemplified in low female readership at the Standard, as well as the mistrust in establishment media expressed by youth respondents. Part of supporting journalists (and/or building independent platforms) is having a strategy for audience development.

#### Impact

The impact of this work will be cumulative, as studies into audience preferences and interests will be foundational for every other media development initiative in Kenya. These studies will greatly increase the likelihood of success, and will come at a key moment, as consumer interests are diversifying and there is growing interests in news outlets that "go deep" on their interests.

#### Level of Effort

Audience research studies require a moderate investment, mostly focused on user research. This is a good first step when developing other initiatives, and is a good opportunity to collaborate with other donors.
