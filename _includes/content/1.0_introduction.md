# Why Fund Kenyan Media?

The Kenyan media has a positive reputation with the international community---but that reputation that does not reflect the reality today. With [XX something about election results], there is an urgent need for international donors to understand the systematic barriers facing journalists in Kenya today, in order to fill a current serious funding gap.

Celebrating Kenya as a "success story" of Africa, many observers describe the media ecosystem as the strongest in the region, if not the continent. But this rosy view from abroad stands in sharp contrast to the lived experiences of journalists, editors, and citizens. On the ground, the situation is frighteningly bleak. A combination of political manipulation and media capitulation have drastically weakened the fifth estate. While Kenya's "vibrant" media ecosystem is still filled with establishment media outlets pumping out content, there is essentially no independent, high-quality journalist organization fulfilling the essential role of government watchdog.

This collapse of the Kenyan media was on full display this past summer, in the lead-up to the August 8 presidential election. During the weeks that Reboot was conducting field research in Nairobi, headlines were naturally dominated by campaigns, politicians, and platforms. Yet instead of objective coverage and critical scrutiny, we found reporting that was largely superficial. Instead of rigorous analyses of policy, we saw gossip, scandals, and rumors, both in print and online. Later, during the election itself, the media failed to adequately monitor polling places, and journalists complained of police harassment. [Example here: Would love a story from research?] Our research confirmed that this "snapshot" of the media during the elections was an accurate reflection of the field's status quo.

Despite the abundant evidence that Kenya's media is unable to provide the unbiased, rigorous journalism necessary for accountability, the international donor community has largely withdrawn its media support in recent years. Most notable is the Ford Foundation, a major funder of independent media in Kenya, which withdrew as part of recent restructuring. Research respondents frequently lamented the broad decline of funding, which has resulted in downsized programs, staff lay-offs, and the disappearance of capacity development initiatives. While there are no official explanations for why this happened, respondents speculated it may have been due to perceptions of Kenya's media as strong and vibrant (and therefore not as much in need of support as other countries). Respondents also speculated that donors were so concerned about corruption that they were giving up; the fact that USAID recently suspended $$XXX in Ministry of Health funding due to corruption allegations gives weight to this belief. The bottom line is that the international donor community has withdrawn support at a critically dangerous time.

In this context, President Uhuru Kenyatta's initial victory in the August 8 election was extremely bad news for the press. Since first taking power in 2013, the Kenyatta administration has antagonized the press and assaulted press freedom in intentional and strategic ways---including pulled ad revenue, paying bribes, and physical threats and intimidation. Kenyatta has displayed a similarly authoritarian attitude toward other pillars of accountability; when the Supreme Court mandated a rerun of the election in October, Kenyatta threatened XXXXX.

Regardless, a negative precedent has been set. Kenyatta has created a blueprint for state capture of a free press. And this blueprint has been especially successful because of longstanding and deeply intertwined economic and political weaknesses in the media: Shallow, low-quality reporting and self-censorship has become the norm, and corrupt practices are not rare; political ownership and influence of the media has eroded audience trust, who rely on multiple sources for their information, including social media.

Kenya's "vibrant" media has failed to deliver the reporting that Kenyans need to make informed decisions. Much of the progress made in the name of press freedom in recent decades has already been lost, and more is at risk.

There is an urgent need for donors to step in---as well as urgent opportunities to go beyond the traditional\
funding models with holistic, integrated, in-it-for-the-long-haul approaches. Securing a free, fair and credible media requires addressing, first and foremost, structural pressures that incentivize bias and self-censorship. Issues like government intimidation and political-biased media ownership subsume issues like capacity and quality of reporting, which are critical but must be considered within this larger context.

To support the media that Kenya deserves, donors must take a holistic and coordinated approach, and offer new types of commitments---moving from short-term, program-based support to long-term core funding. This report offers a systems view of the current media ecosystem, in order to give donors the information needed to take the necessary systems approach.
