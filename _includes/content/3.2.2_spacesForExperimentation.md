## 2.Spaces for Experimentation

### Experiment with alternative media Â - Create a "media lab" to experiment with alternative and creative storytelling Situated in a university (artists, film makers etc)

#### Influence

-   Government has put a lot of pressure to undermine media independence

-   Being critical of the government puts media organizations and journalists at risk

-   Need other ways of conveying information, criticizing government that might be harder for government to target

-   Need to create a space/organization to experiment, prototype, that provides some shelter from risks involved with launching new ventures.

#### Opportunity Description

-   A lab, similar to Nieman Lab of MiT Civic Media lab that brings together people in media and from outside to experiment with alternative models for information production, and dissemination

-   This could range from documentary filmmaking or technology to embedding news and information into entertainment

-   This could also serve as a locus of ideas for Kenyans to find solutions to fill this independent media vacuum

-   Kenya is not new to hubs or labs

-   Could be standalone or affiliated with university

-   Would need to assess where

#### Impact

-   Given the critical importance of finding ways of boosting independent media, and particularly if Kenyatta wins, a space for independent innovation in Kenya media will be critical for creating a safe space to incubate ideas

-   Labs could have different focus areas and inspire cross-sector pollination and bring in new types of actors.

#### Level of Effort

-   The lab would need to be well-resourced, and attract top talent. It would also require a very creative and strategic team to identify creative change makers and include them

#### Other Considerations
