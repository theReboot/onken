# The Accountability Ecosystem in Kenya Today

Understanding the current Kenyan media landscape, and its strength as a public gatekeeper and watchdog, requires examining the strength and character of media's relationship with the other "accountability ecosystem" constituents: **Government**, **Citizens**, and **Civil Society**. As this study attempts to show, interactions between media and these constituents create pressures and incentives, which influence media's ability to provide independent, unbiased reporting on issues of public interest. This report analyzes these pressures, as well as media's responses, to understand how different factors influence media's ability to produce robust, critical, and independent journalism.

In the first section, we examine the **Media** itself to explore how financial struggles are forcing establishment media companies to downsize their newsrooms, which in turn has contributed to a decline in the quality of reporting and the capacity of journalists. We also look at gender imbalances within Kenya's media, which has implications for the future leadership of women in media organizations and the representativeness of reporting. We then explore the role of the other three constituents---Government, Citizens, and Civil Society---and the pressures and incentives they bring to bear on Kenyan media's ability to produce quality reporting in the public interest. We assess the impact of these pressures through a Free and Fair Scale, which illustrates whether a particular incentive or pressure is contributing to a stronger media landscape, or weakening it. For example, a decline in revenue for establishment media has forced staff layoffs, reducing the media's capacity to produce sustained reporting on important issues, while leaving many journalists economically vulnerable. This receives a negative score on the scale, because the media now has reduced capacity to fulfil its mandate as a public watchdog.

We define civil society broadly, encompassing community-based organizations, religious organizations, and other non-governmental and non-commercial groups.
