### Pressures and incentives

Across all mediums, most media companies have struggled to find appropriate business models for a changing economic environment. As a consequence, leading companies have radically downsized over the past eighteen months. The Nation Media Group, for instance, [closed two FM radio station](https://twitter.com/NationMediaGrp/status/748393955688128516/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.africanews.com%2F2016%2F06%2F30%2Fkenya-s-nation-media-group-shuts-down-tv-and-radio-stations%2F) (opting for an online stream) and consolidated two television stations into one.

#### Declining revenue limits journalists’ capacity

With financial troubles fundamentally changing newsrooms, respondents were eager for new funding streams and models to enable them to do the kind of rigorous, impactful journalism. Right now, newsrooms are operating below capacity, as the withdrawal of government advertising revenue has led to the loss of thousands of jobs. For example, respondents reported that, as part of a major restructuring, the Standard had laid off 1,500 people.

As a result of these layoffs, newsrooms increasingly depend on freelancers and correspondents, instead of full time staff reporters, which has resulted in the "juniorisation" of the newsroom. This extends to editors as well. Without resources, mentorship, or professional support, young journalists are thrown into the deep end. Even experienced journalists are overstretched, as fewer staff are responsible for producing more content (and across multiple platforms). These forces, in turn, hurt the quality of reporting, create barriers to investigative journalism, and increase incentives for "pay-to-play" journalism.

#### Need for targeted training

There are many talented and professional journalists in Kenya. Still, capacity was a frequent point of conversation with journalists, editors, media experts, and civil society groups. The previous culture of mentorship amongst journalists has mostly disappeared. Many respondents lamented the lack of hands-on training in the education system.

A number of actors are working to fill this gap: The Media Council of Kenya (among other groups) operates a number of trainings, as are some actors in civil society;  a few international NGOS are providing mentorship and training. However, respondents broadly acknowledged that capacity is a major challenge. There is a need for holistic, sustained training programs that are based on an authentic understanding of journalists' needs, especially mentorship- or fellowship-style programs that would provide real-world opportunities to report and publish work.

#### Gender imbalance in newsrooms

Female readers and viewers are a massive (potential) market for Kenyan media; one editor noted that at his newspaper, male readership is 70 percent---suggesting there is growth potential in producing content to attract and engage female readers. Addressing the gender imbalance in newsrooms may be one way to help reach this potential.  

The lack of gender equality does not seem to be in the pipeline of journalists. Kenyan communication and journalism schools are flush with aspiring female journalists, in some cases outnumbering male students. But newsrooms are still heavily male dominated. This is consistent with research in 2015 by the Media Council of Kenya, which examined 912 news articles and found only [7 percent were written by women](http://www.daogewe.org/index.php/publications/reports/34-the-gender-agenda-assessing-gender-issues-in-the-media/file). (In this report, we struggled to achieve gender balance in our respondents, due to the lopsided makeup of the field).

One reason may be the prevalence of sexual harassment of young female journalists in newsrooms, which compounds a well-documented, [global trend](https://ijnet.org/en/blog/how-newsrooms-can-fight-online-harassment-targeting-female-journalists) of online harassment toward female journalists. These forces are narrowing the pipeline of female journalists rising through the ranks of media. By acknowledging and factoring these norms into interventions, the media and its supporters can begin addressing these issues.
