In many ways, Kenya's civil society sector and its media sector are in the same boat. Like the media, civil society has a history and reputation for being relatively robust and professional compared to its neighbors in the region and the continent. And, like the media, civil society has been forced to work in a shrinking civic space, against an increasingly antagonistic government and with rapidly decreasing support from donors.

The government attack on civil society was vividly apparent in the days after the August 8 election, when Kenya's NGO regulator[  attempted to shut down](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/08/kenya-attempts-to-shut-down-human-rights-groups-unlawful-and-irresponsible/) two human rights organizations, both of which were involved in elections monitoring. The attempt followed previous patterns---in 2016, the Kenyatta administration[  expelled a USD$20 million program](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/12/20/kenya-stops-us-election-education-program-ahead-polls.html) by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, claiming the organization was a clandestine attempt to sway elections.

Yet despite their similar challenges---and their aligned governance goals---the two sectors are largely disconnected in Kenya, with negative perceptions and mistrust on both sides.

We define civil society organizations (CSOs) broadly in this report, encompassing community-based organizations, religious organizations, and other non-governmental and non-commercial groups.
