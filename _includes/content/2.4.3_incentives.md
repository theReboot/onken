### Pressures & Incentives

-   The issues affecting national-level outlets are also very real challenges at the local level:

-   Ownership; a debilitating reliance on shrinking ad revenue; Interference, intimidation and capture by local governments; Low journalistic capacity.

-   But these constraints are often amplified at the lower level by particularly competitive and contentious politics, shifting political alliances, etc.

-   For example, there is no corporate ad revenue at the local level. One media actor noted that we "cannot monetize the rural areas."

#### Little competitive pressure between outlets

-   Unlike urban counterparts, which are pressured to cover stories that break in competing outlets, rural media are rarely forced to cover a story; they're the only game in town.

-   Competitive pressure from social media is also lower; Resources tend to be more constrained, particularly in rural areas, which means that even if people have the technology and the will to get more info, they might not be able to afford "bundles."

-   This is especially true in radio, which is a key source of information, particularly in local language, or vernacular radio

#### Closer relationship to government

-   At the same time, a number of respondents commented that elections are mainly decided in rural areas where people vote along tribal lines irrespective of candidate's platform.

-   The relationship between people and government is closer at the local level - there is potential for tighter accountability loops.
