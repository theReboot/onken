### 5. Grants for Investigative Journalism

### Providing travel grants and basket funds for investigative journalists can lead to important new accountability stories.

#### Opportunity

Most journalists are now freelancers, underpaid and producing work that is under-published. To increase their potential, donors could establish a system to fund journalists pursuing important investigative stories. Such funding programs exist in other countries, and there are lessons learned to draw from when creating one tailored for Kenya. This opportunity is best paired with a media partnership or one of the distribution platforms, as discussed.

#### Impact

Creating financial incentives for dedicated journalists would help raise the level of professionalism in the field, and potentially raise standards and expectations overall. Ideally, published stories would also spark new audience engagements, although they would not address structural issues of independence. Such grants would also need to be tied to places to publish and/or given in tandem with training programs to help journalists develop expertise in specific areas.
