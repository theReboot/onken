In many ways, Kenya's civil society sector and its media sector are in the same boat. Like the media, civil society has a history and reputation for being relatively robust and professional. And, like the media, civil society has been forced to work in a shrinking civic space, against increasing government pressure and with decreasing support from donors.

The government attack on civil society was apparent in the days after the August 8 election, when Kenya's NGO regulator[  attempted to shut down](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/08/kenya-attempts-to-shut-down-human-rights-groups-unlawful-and-irresponsible/) two human rights organizations, both of which were involved in elections monitoring.

Yet despite their similar challenges---and their aligned governance goals---the two sectors are largely disconnected in Kenya, with negative perceptions and mistrust on both sides. This in turn hurts Kenyans, who would benefit from the increased transparency and accountability that is typically generated by positive media-civil society relations.

We define civil society organizations (CSOs) broadly in this report, encompassing community-based organizations, religious organizations, and other non-governmental and non-commercial groups.
