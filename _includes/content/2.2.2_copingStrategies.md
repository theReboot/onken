### How media copes

In response to government pressure, media organizations can either self-censor (as a risk-mitigation strategy, as well as a financial one) or push back against government overreach. When journalists choose the latter path, resisting government pressure and publishing stories that hold the powerful accountable, they run serious risks. Some have been testing new tactics to protect themselves while ensuring their coverage reaches the Kenyan citizens who need it.

Journalists have been experimenting with the limits of political power over their careers, and have discovered some nascent and effective strategies. For example, one strategy for bringing critical coverage to the public is to share the story: journalists will pass along promising leads to a colleague, seeking to make a story public even if they themselves feel unable to publish it. They may also circulate leads to many journalists, encouraging widespread coverage of the issue---a practice one respondent described as "spreading the risk." This practice, which arises out of necessity, presents an opportunity to increase and institutionalize these solidarity efforts, providing some additional political cover to journalists who are taking risks.

Journalists are also experimenting with ways to hold government to account for its attacks on the free press. Some respondents shared stories of successfully subjecting government to widespread public criticism. For example, journalists who have been threatened by political actors will sometimes respond publicly and aggressively to those efforts. By naming the individuals who are issuing threats, journalists have drawn public anger against oppression, and rallied other journalists to stand in solidarity. By supporting more solidarity and better coordination among journalists, it may be possible to carve out additional space for journalists to report in the public good.

On the other hand, many newsrooms have adopted a culture of self-censorship, softening their coverage or avoiding topics that could draw the negative attention of political interests. Many engage in shallow reporting, often simply "repeating the official government line." Media support strategies will necessarily need to find ways to disincentivize self-censorship.

Some respondents also described instances where journalists and editors have accepted payments from politicians in exchange for favorable coverage. For example, a journalist might accept a one-time payment to omit certain details. At the other end of the spectrum, a respondent described the "symbiotic" relationship between an entire government agency and a publication, which agreed to provide only favorable coverage in exchange for exclusive access to that agency.
