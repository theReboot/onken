### How civil society pressures and incentivizes media

CSOs are well aware of the need for media coverage to further their goals; however, they are in need of greater understanding of media---as well as skills to engage with media---in order to more effectively exert their influence.

When Kenyan CSOs and media cooperate, they both benefit. One freelance journalist called NGOs and CSOs "great links to story ideas." Another respondent who participated in a civil society-facilitated gender training in Mombasa described it as not only entertaining but transformational. This training successfully sparked debate, helping important gender issues resonate with the (largely male) audience by encouraging them to relate the topic to their own female family members. To this respondent, civil society trainings must be personal and compelling, and can transform the way journalists think about social issues.

Another CSO respondent described the story of a health facility, which was put at risk due to a "land grab" by government officials. Within a few hours of hearing the news, the CSO organized a demonstration via WhatsApp with hospital patients. They simultaneously organized a press briefing in Nairobi for media. The attention successfully drew the attention of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, and within three weeks the land was returned to the health facility. Investments that support such productive alliances between the CSO and journalism sectors hold great promise for good governance.

On the other hand, CSOs and media need to overcome general mistrust between each other. The sectors primarily interact with each other through personal connections, instead of institutional relationships. For example, one respondent told us that his CSO employs a number of former journalists: "We work with a selection of key journalists that we knew from when most of us were journalists ourselves. This helps with our advocacy."

Outside of personal connections, CSOs and journalists mistrust each other's priorities. One CSO respondent noted that "media always want sensational stories, and think the development issues can wait until tomorrow." A journalist similarly expressed frustration after discussing a human interest story with a CSO and discovering it was too promotional.

There is a need to improve communication skills and understanding between CSOs and journalists, including developing CSOs' media outreach capacity.
