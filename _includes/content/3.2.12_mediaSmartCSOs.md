### 12. Media Smart CSOs

### Providing CSOs with better communication resources can improve their media relationships and lead to new public interest media coverage.

#### Opportunity

Civil society are generally poor at engaging the media, as they often lack strategic communications skills as well as follow-through. Kenyan CSOs would benefit from strategic communications support, either through funding new skilled staff or by training existing staff in pitching and framing stories for media, as well as skills in working with journalists and the characters of human interest stories.

#### Impact

While this is not strictly a media development initiative, donors may find that supporting CSO communications capacity is an effective backchannel. Practical improvements in the day-to-day interactions between CSOs and media can lead to better media engagement, which will also break down silos between the sectors over time.

#### Level of Effort

This is a relatively minimal strategy, as strategic communication trainings could be small (even a small investment would yield large improvement over the current status quo). For the greatest impact, donors should support CSOs to budget yearly strategic media planning, ensuring that their communications work is proactive and realistic (avoiding previous problems with follow-through).
