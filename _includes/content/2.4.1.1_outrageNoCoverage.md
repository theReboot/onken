### Outrage, But No Coverage, For Key Political Events

The importance of strong relationships between media and CSOs was highlighted by one CSO respondent who described the lack of coverage for police accountability. Â 

Since 2012, Kenyan police have committed dozens of [extrajudicial killings](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38239138) in a mainly Muslim region of the country. Although the human rights group Haki Africa broke the story in December 2016, it was largely absent from establishment media.

CSOs blamed the media's silence on government pressure. One CSO attempted to organize an event with elected leaders in order to raise awareness about the story, but several officials who had committed to come---including one who had helped organize the event---stopped communicating at the last minute. Rumors suggested that an order not to attend had come from high-level political actors. The news story trickled into Kenya through extensive international media coverage and through social media. But without the collaboration and support of the Kenyan media, major CSO efforts to draw attention to the issue were unsuccessful in pressuring government to respond.
