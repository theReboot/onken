### Social media as a tool to control public messaging

Since 2007, political parties, political candidates, and the state have become increasingly adept at using social media to circumvent media and reach citizens directly, to self-promote, and to manipulate public perceptions. Reportedly, the Jubilee administration has proudly called itself a "digital government," and uses that expertise to influence public opinion.

Although the Communications Authority has issued regulations against the [dissemination of hate speech](https://www.theelephant.info/uploads/2017/10/CAK-and-NCIC-Joint-Statement-on-User-Generated-Content-on-Social-Media-Platforms-During-the-Electioneering-Period.pdf), critics argue they are too broad and [open to abuse](http://www.dw.com/en/kenya-warns-of-social-media-crackdown-ahead-of-polls/a-39783282). Indeed, several respondents reported that bloggers have been engaged by political interests to spread rumors and harass adversaries online. Both Jubilee and NASA [reportedly](https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/06/06/uhuru-raila-teams-take-campaign-wars-online_c1574589) employed bloggers to attack opponents during the 2017 presidential campaign. It was widely reported that the Jubilee campaign employed Cambridge Analytica, the controversial data and analytics firm that supported both Donald Trump's presidential campaign in the U.S., and the pro-Brexit campaign in the U.K. While it is difficult to determine the exact role this firm played in the Jubilee campaign, the company allegedly specializes in "psychographics" and "data driven [online] campaigns." Likewise, Privacy International [reports](https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/954) that the Jubilee campaign retained an American company, Harris Media, to produce a "viral, anonymous attack campaign," hinting further at the current government's efforts to shape the digital communications' landscape to serve its own ends.

Yet, on the whole, social media has been a positive force for independent media and freedom of expression, providing new channels for Kenyans to express themselves, publicly pressure the government, and disseminate information not picked up by establishment media. This is illustrated through media coverage of a country-wide doctor's strike, which stretched for 100 days from January through March 2017. Doctors went on strike to demand that the government implement a collective bargaining agreement from 2013, which had provisions for increasing the pay of doctors working at public hospitals and clinics. In the absence of in-depth coverage by establishment media, social media was an important tool for the doctors to air their grievances, and present a counter narrative to that of the state. The government [had tried to present](https://mobilisationlab.org/three-ways-kenyan-union-used-social-media/) the striking doctors as "greedy" and "enemies of public health."

A private nurse remembered, "The media coverage was bad. The message got distorted and it misrepresented issues. It failed to energize people. This strike should have broken the government, but it didn't. It went for 100 days without a public outcry." For a journalist who covered the strike, the media failed to present in-depth and compelling reporting. She explained, "The media was only concentrating on the reactive. They did a good job but they didn't go into how the strike was affecting specific areas, such as maternal health. This was because the pressure was too high---all the negotiating, it was intense and they were blinded by the strike itself. But, if journalists were able to report about the effects of the strike on different areas, it may have convinced politicians to move faster than they did."

As a result, doctors took their stories to social media, [evoking](https://qz.com/866551/lipakamatender-kenyas-striking-medical-workers-are-using-social-media-to-challenge-the-government/) the negative impact of state corruption on the health system, showcasing the difficult working conditions and inadequate facilities and supplies they contended with. As a result of this pressure, the government ultimately [agreed to raise](http://www.dw.com/en/kenya-doctors-sign-deal-to-end-longest-ever-medical-strike-over-pay-working-conditions/a-37936822) doctors' salaries.
