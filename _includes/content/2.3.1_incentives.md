### How citizens pressure and incentivize media

  <p>Kenyans may trust the media more than they trust the government, but this is a very low bar.</p>

Every respondent we spoke with expressed some level of frustration with the media---a finding consistent with research by Afrobarometer showing only 39 percent of Kenyans "[trust the media a lot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6ORDgrjEYhdC1wTXlGeFlwSWM/view?usp=sharing)."

#### Low trust in media

Many citizens believe the media has been captured by the ruling elite. Respondents were acutely aware of the political motivations of the owners of establishment media organizations (see [Constituent 2](#government)). Respondents noted that it is particularly difficult to know what stories are being left out (as opposed to simply bias reporting) because of these commercial and political considerations.

#### Triangulating news and information from multiple platforms

As a result of this distrust, an overwhelming trend amongst our urban respondents was a reliance on multiple sources of media for information. Because they do not fully trust any one source, Kenyans triangulate information through multiple outlets, and complement that with information provided to them through both in-person and online social networks. WhatsApp was one of the most important sources of information for many respondents. People overwhelmingly received (and shared) articles and discussed news via the messaging platform.

#### Relying on social media and the risks of "fake news"

Internet usage estimates vary considerably in Kenya, from 67 to 90 percent, depending on the source, while social media use remains considerably lower across the country as a whole. (Recent figures suggests about [7 million Facebook users](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-election-facebook/facebook-offers-tool-to-combat-fake-news-in-kenya-ahead-of-polls-idUSKBN1AK1IU), [10 million](https://ifree.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/State-of-Internet-Report-Kenya-2016.pdf) Whatsapp users, and [2 million](https://ifree.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/State-of-Internet-Report-Kenya-2016.pdf) Twitter users.) Nevertheless, in Nairobi, [where social media usage is most concentrated](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2017/09/04/the-tyranny-of-numbers-on-social-media-during-kenyas-2017-elections/), Facebook, Whatsapp, and Twitter are extremely important channels for accessing and triangulating information.

Given the heavy reliance on these apps, it was reassuring that many respondents expressed a healthy understanding of the potential for misinformation online (a finding backed by [polling data](http://blog.geopoll.com/geopoll-and-portland-launch-a-survey-report-on-fake-news-in-kenya)). One respondent told us that online conversations were fast, diverse, and resilient enough to challenge rumor and fake news, and surface the truth. However, another expressed the opposite opinion, calling Kenyans "uncritical," too quick to share news without evaluating it. We believe the truth is somewhere in the middle. There is clearly value in social media in the absence of a strong independent media. But it also increases the risks of rumor mongering and user manipulation, and separates those with access from those who do not.
