### 2. Hosting Alternative Media Labs

### Dedicated spaces for experimenting with creative storytelling and novel partnerships would tap into new ways of engaging audiences (and would inspire journalists and media entrepreneurs).

#### Opportunity

In the face of government pressure, journalists need creative ways to capture audience attention with critical narratives. Media supporters could sow the seeds of long-term impact by creating a space for media actors to experiment and prototype new models of storytelling---especially alongside filmmakers, artists, social media experts, technologists, and other cross-disciplinary collaborators. A "media lab," in the model of Nieman Lab or MIT Civic Media Lab, could spark exciting new ventures in Kenya, and help to surface promising journalists and other media entrepreneurs. The exact focus and mission, as well as where it is situated---within a university, or as an independent institution---should be driven by the Kenyan journalists who would lead such a venture.

#### Impact

Boosting independent media will require bold new models to engage and activate citizen audiences. Creating a space for incubation could nurture the kinds of alternative media companies that would reinvigorate Kenyans' trust in media (and many of this report's recommendations would benefit from such a space, where ideas can receive the design and testing necessary).
