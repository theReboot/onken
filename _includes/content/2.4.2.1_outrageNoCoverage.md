### Outrage, But No Coverage, For Key Political Events

Since 2012, Kenyan police have committed dozens of [extrajudicial killings](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38239138) in a mainly Muslim region of the country, which the establishment media has consistently not covered. In December 2016, the human rights group Haki Africa broke the story, but it was still largely absent from establishment media.

A number of CSO respondents expressed deep frustration with journalists' unwillingness to cover the killings, and blamed the silence on government pressure. One CSO attempted to organize an event with elected leaders in order to raise awareness about the story, but several officials who had committed to come---including one who had helped organize the event---stopped communicating at the last minute; rumors suggested that an order not to attend had come directly from the President's office. The story trickled into Kenya through extensive international media coverage and through social media. But without the collaboration and support of the Kenyan media, major CSO efforts to draw attention to the issue were unable to successfully pressure government to respond.

This incident highlights both the failure of media to hold the police accountable and the pressure media face from certain political quarters not to do so. At the same time, it also hints at the potential strong media-CSO relations could have to keep the public informed.
