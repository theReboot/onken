### Reintroducing fact-checking

In the age of social media, with its attendant risk of quick-spreading rumors, fact-checking is a steep but vital challenge facing media actors all over the world. In Kenya, some media outlets have attempted to fill the gap, such as the Nation Media Group, which has instituted a fact-checking effort, [Newsplex](http://www.nation.co.ke/newsplex/2718262-2718262-3vbltsz/index.html). A respondent from the Nation described Newsplex as "a fundamental public good." He said, "This is seen as part of our corporate social responsibility. The current election period calls for this kind of an effort given the volume of fake news circulating through social media."

**Africa Check**, which receives funding from Omidyar Network, is an independent fact-checking organization, serving Senegal, Nigeria, South Africa, and, most recently, Kenya. Seeking to change the status quo within the media industry, the organization posts the majority of its fact-checking work online. Its target audiences include journalists and media actors, as well as politicians and government actors, who receive their reports through a mailing list, social media, or the website directly.
