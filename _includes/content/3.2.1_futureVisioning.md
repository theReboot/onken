### 1. Designing the Future of Independent Media

### Convening creative, field-leading journalists to brainstorm can build the foundation of future problem-solving in Kenya.

#### Opportunity

For any effort to support independent journalism to be successful, implementers must be able to identify the right local media partners to support---and must get their ideas, and buy-in, for the ongoing work. Before any intervention in the Kenyan media landscape, it would be useful to convene journalists and media actors to begin a dialogue on the future of Kenya's independent media.

#### Impact

Engaging in equitable, open conversations with and amongst media actors in Kenya is vital to identifying and prioritizing workable ideas. Such an event would help strengthen a community of practice in Kenya and could catalyze the networks that will be tasked with implementing new ideas. This is a critical first step to any investments in Kenyan media in any thematic area.
