### 6. Holistic Support for Capacity Development

### Providing well-designed trainings and mentorship opportunities, tailored to journalist demand, can fill urgent capacity gaps.

#### Opportunity

Capacity, particularly among younger journalists, was cited as one of the greatest challenges to a strong independent media. Kenyan media is not new to training, particularly donor-supported trainings. However, researchers heard frustrations that university journalism programs are not providing enough practical skills, while donor-supported trainings are not designed to meet the felt needs of journalists. At the same, mentorship, an important source of support for young journalists, has all but disappeared. As such, a shift toward "journalist-centered" training may be necessary. This means designing training programs around the explicit needs of the journalists being supported, and connecting them to opportunities they need to sharpen their skills. This might mean establishing a series of trainings on a particular topic in partnership with a publisher who can both support and publish reporting.

For individual journalists, a truly effective training program can be transformational. Importantly, for a training program to have any impact at all, it must be designed---in other words, trainings must be based on a solid foundation of user research, and then created and improved in an iterative process in collaboration with journalists.
