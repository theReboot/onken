### Scrappy Grassroot Groups Push Back

Bloggers are a relatively new part of the Kenyan media ecosystem, and respondents described a high level of distrust for them in the larger media community. In some cases, this distrust seems to be warranted. Trolling and rumors spread via social media are features of Kenya's media landscape---we heard about this frequently from respondents. But we also heard about bloggers, like [Owaahh](http://owaahh.com/) and [Gathara's Worl](https://gathara.blogspot.com/)d, who are providing critical and independent analysis. One network, the Bloggers Association of Kenya BAKE, is seeking to dispel this distrust and build the credibility of Kenya's bloggers.

BAKE started in 2011 and grew as a membership group to support individual bloggers while also focusing on policy issues. Members get a card, which they can use to access press events, and they proudly display membership badges on their blogs. The organization also provides bloggers access to legal representatives.

While its impact is still nascent, BAKE is actively combatting government intimidation through solidarity. Following massive superfluous arrests of bloggers, BAKE spearheaded a campaign for media rights, called #iFreeKE. Working with and learning from key long-time internet freedom advocacy groups in Kenya, the organization has played a key role in pushing for policy reform that protects bloggers.

BAKE is one of a few grassroots groups (Network of Freelance Journalists is another) which are organizing to protect media actors and advocate for greater freedom. These efforts are currently largely isolated and under-resourced; additional funding and support is needed to accelerate their impact.
