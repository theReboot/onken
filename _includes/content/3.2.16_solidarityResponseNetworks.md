## 16. Solidarity Response Networks

### Create/encourage a "solidarity" network of journalists for safety and pushing back on government intimidation; this could also support legally (and advocacy?)

#### Influence

-   Govt intentionally intimidating journalists and media outlets

-   Number of respondents commented on the importance of journalistic solidarity to challenge government oppression

-   If there is enough outrage, government will back down

#### Opportunity Description

-   Institutionalize what is an informal response

-   Form a membership network, with governance, and standard operating procedures to track government intimidation and oppression and guarantee a sustained collective response

-   A "NATO for JOurnalists"

#### Impact

-   While this is not guaranteed to stop government, it could play an important role in risk mitigation for journalists, if they know the community will do what it can to protect them

#### Level of Effort

-   high

#### Other Considerations
