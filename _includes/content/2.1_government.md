## Constituent 1: Government

The government is by far the media's largest and most insidious antagonist in Kenya. The space for political dissent has contracted rapidly since 2013---Example?. This chilling effect has been exceptionally palpable in the press, as the Kenyatta administration has targeted media actors with increasing aggressiveness.

-   This is partly due to the character of the Kenyatta administration. A number of respondents described:  

-   An authoritarian and anti-democratic disposition by the current leadership, which can be attributed to its relationship to Jomo Kenyatta and his successor Daniel arap Moi, who held onto power for 24 years.

-   Anger by the current administration toward the media and civil society, which they perceived backed and kept alive the International Criminal Court case against the incumbent president. [Example: Need a few more details on the ICC case]

-   Rampant, blatant and accelerating corruption by the administration, which they do not want to stop

If Kenyatta is defeated in the October election, there may be new space for the media to stretch its muscles. Anything more about the election - to discuss?  

Yet no matter the outcome, the press has already been dramatically weakened by government attack, and a dangerous precedent has already been set. Citizens have little trust in media. Journalist morale is low. The government's interconnected, concerted effort has effectively declawed the media in the short term; a holistic approach will be necessary, and quickly, if the country's media is to recover.
