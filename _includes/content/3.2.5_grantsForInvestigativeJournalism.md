### 5. Grants for Investigative Journalism

### Providing travel grants and basket funds for investigative journalists can lead to important new accountability stories.

#### Opportunity

Most journalists are now freelancers, underpaid and producing work that is under-published. To increase their potential, donors could establish a system to fund journalists pursuing important investigative stories. Such funding programs exist in other countries, such as the [Pulitzer Center's travel grants](https://pulitzercenter.org/grants), that offerlessons learned for creating one tailored for Kenya. This opportunity is best paired with a media partnership or one of the distribution platforms, as discussed.

#### Impact

Creating financial incentives for dedicated journalists would inspire more to pursue in-depth, investigative stories. Ideally, published stories would also spark new audience engagements. Grants would need to be tied to outlets to publish, and/or given in tandem with training programs, to help journalists develop expertise in specific areas.
