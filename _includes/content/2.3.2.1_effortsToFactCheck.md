### Reintroducing fact-checking

In the age of social media, with its attendant risk of quick-spreading rumors, fact-checking is a steep but vital challenge facing media actors all over the world. In Kenya, some media outlets have attempted to fill the gap, such as The Nation newspaper, which has instituted a fact-checking effort, **[Newsplex](http://www.nation.co.ke/newsplex/2718262-2718262-3vbltsz/index.html)**.

**Africa Check** is an independent fact-checking organization, serving Senegal, Nigeria, South Africa, and, most recently, Kenya. Seeking to change the status quo within the media industry, the organization posts the majority of its fact-checking work online. Its target audiences include journalists and media actors, as well as politicians and government actors, who receive reports through a mailing list, social media, or the website directly. Africa Check also hosts a weekly TV show on KTN, challenging politicians' incorrect statements on the air. While the producers see their work as part of constructive debate, they say some viewers see them as more superficial political maneuvering.

As social media spreads throughout the country, opportunities to encourage and strengthen fact-checking efforts (both independent organizations and within media organizations) will help build trust, and is thus an important opportunity for long-term audience development.
