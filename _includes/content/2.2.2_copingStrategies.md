### How media responds (coping strategies)

Cumulatively, through an appetite for news and information and especially through a passion for social media, citizens in Kenya today are putting pressure on the media industry to innovate and improve its work.

Recognizing that the public consumes a wide variety of media, many establishment outlets have struggled to identify and stick to a specific market or target audience. Instead, as one respondent told us, establishment media is "trying to be everything to everybody."

This not only fails to develop loyal followers, but undermines a media outlet's credibility, as salacious scandal-driven coverage appears alongside serious information in the public interest. Even a cursory glance at the front pages of Kenya's leading newspapers, the Daily Nation and the Standard, suggests both their strategy and their struggle to acquire and maintain an audience. When headlines like  XXXX and XXX exist together on the front pages, it hurts the credibility of these organizations to be a check on government accountability.

At its core, this is about media failing to understand the audience. There seems to be a gap between what our urban respondents want in their reporting and what traditional media believes they want. A group of students interviewed were frustrated with media's failing to cover topics they were interested in such as technology and innovation---saying that traditional media houses just assumed that young people want tabloids and gossip.

The widespread public perception that media outlets are politically biased because of ownership has influenced newsroom standards in an unusual way: A fear of seeming biased because of political ownership has, counterintuitively, contributed to the perception of bias. Recognizing the public's perception, many establishment outlets will publish critical or negative stories after another outlet covers it. Ironically, this competition is likely the result of political competition between owners. Because owners are not aligned politically, one is sometimes willing to publish a critical story, which then the others will be forced to cover to avoid accusations of political bias.

However, this does not lead to true coverage of important issues. Editors seek to "balance" their coverage, especially in political stories, by publishing equal numbers of negative and positive stories about opposing party leaders. This of course must be balanced with the need to avoid overly negative coverage of people and issues with which ownership has a vested interest.

The flaw was on full display during the election campaign: If a negative story came out about a candidate, many papers seemed to feel compelled to publish a negative story about the candidate's opponent, in order to avoid accusations of political favoritism. [Example?] The public's reaction to this tactic has been at best cynical and largely critical.  

<!-- #### Covering stories that break on social media  (positive action) -->

The pressure of social media, where news breaks more quickly, is also putting competitive pressure on editors and journalists. Almost all media respondents noted that breaking news has become the purvey of social media; stories that might otherwise have been censored, self-censored, or ignored by the establishment media gain traction online, forcing newspapers and television stations to cover the issues. For example, 30 people were rushed to the hospital after a cholera outbreak at a hotel this summer. Because the hotel was affiliated with a prominent politician in the Kenyatta administration, some respondents suggested the issue would not have had much coverage if it were not for social media; the story was covered critically in establishment outlets, including [The Nation](http://www.nation.co.ke/counties/nairobi/government-apparent-attempt-cover-up-cholera-outbreak-weston/1954174-3986100-11xk3ci/index.html).

<!-- #### Shifting to digital platforms -->

A few journalists have had success with publishing content digitally, in order to circumvent the constraints of establishment media organizations and to tap directly into citizens' trust of social media. Common platforms are personal websites, Facebook, and YouTube. While this is uncommon, some of these journalists have been able to build sizeable followings, often through publishing news analysis (rather than investigative journalism or news coverage).  For example, Owaah? Others? Need example of bloggers to cite. A number of respondents in the media sector acknowledged the importance of these bloggers specifically for their ability to cover stories that would be censored at establishment media houses. Publishing online liberates journalists from reliance on ad revenue and the pressures of ownership (although they are still subject to government intimidation - possibly cite Roger Ailes' arrest here?). While it is difficult to sustain financially, publishing online connects journalists more closely to citizen voices, as they are interacting in real-time online---this has the potential to establish a positive feedback loop.

Many outlets are struggling to catch up to the digital age of media. Some establishment media houses have set up digital portals that unintentionally compete with the print editions. All of the media outlets are struggling to monetize their digital content; only one outlet, XXXX, has set up a paywall. However, respondents working at establishment media houses frequently discussed the importance of digital work, and the pressure that social media is putting to shift the kind and style of content that newsrooms publish. A respondent at The Nation discussed expanding the newspaper's online presence, incorporating video and interactive storytelling, which are only possible online; he told us that since social media has taken over the role of breaking news, they are trying to find new angles to stories and to provide deeper coverage with more context (although we did not yet see evidence that this has been successful).

There seems to be a large gap in digital leadership in establishment media. The major counterexample is Wachira Waruru, who leads Royal Media Services, a company that runs fourteen radio stations and the popular entertainment television channel Citizen TV. Waruru has shown a willingness to embrace new technologies, keeping in touch with technology and hiring a director of Social Media. He also seems more in touch with audience diversity (the company produces radio content in 12 different languages). This adaptiveness to technology has proven to be a successful business strategy, as the company has overtaken longer-running media companies. Note: Should we add a sentence saying, Waruru isn't a role model - I'm guessing he is also politically connected - but he shows that adapting to technology is financially viable strategy?
