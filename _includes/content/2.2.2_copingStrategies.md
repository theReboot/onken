### How media copes

In response to government pressure, establishment media organizations have largely adopted a detrimental culture of self-censorship amongst both journalists and editors. However, there are some courageous journals who are willing to take risks, pushing back on government intimidation and pushing to the limits of censorship.

The culture of self-censorship prevalent in newsrooms today restricts coverage more explicitly than owner influence. Journalists and editors generally maintain an acute awareness of the networks between powerful individuals and interests, in order to do much of the work of political censorship themselves; they frequently avoid topics that could draw the ire of their bosses and related politicians. Many engage in shallow, low-quality reporting, often simply "repeating the official government line."

Many respondents reported that it is common for journalists and editors to accept payments from politicians in exchange for favorable coverage. This is partly driven by the culture where political connections (instead of quality journalism) are highly prized. One respondent noted that young journalists see frequent evidence that this behavior is rewarded, such as editors driving cars far beyond their salary range.

Such practices extend to both the organizational and the individual level. For example, a journalist might accept a one-time payment to omit certain details, or the arrangement might be extended; one respondent described the "symbiotic" relationship between an entire government agency and a publication, which agreed to provide only favorable coverage in exchange for exclusive access to that agency.

For journalists who resist government pressure, one strategy for bringing critical coverage is to share the coverage. Some journalists will pass along promising leads to a colleague, seeking to make a story public even if they themselves feel unable to publish it. Others described circulating leads around to many journalists to ensure widespread coverage---a practice one respondent described as "spreading the risk."

Respondents did note that in some cases the government will respond to widespread public criticism. As a result, one strategy we heard about was for journalists under threat to respond publicly and aggressively to efforts at intimidation, naming the individuals issuing threats, in order to draw public anger and rally other journalists to stand in solidarity.
