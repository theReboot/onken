### How citizens pressure and incentivize media

Our findings dramatically contradict the accepted international wisdom about Kenya, that media is vibrant and trusted. While some studies and polls suggest high levels of trust in the media relative to other institutions, our research showed that this benchmark is extremely low. Nearly every research respondent expressed a level of frustration and disgust with the media.

#### Low trust in media

Many citizens see the media as enmeshed in ruling elite corruption. Respondents were acutely aware of the political motivations of the owners of establishment media organizations (see Constituent 1). Respondents noted that it is difficult to know what stories are being left out because of these commercial and political considerations.

Tribalism is another, frequently cited source of bias in news outlets; as in other parts of Kenyan society, tribal bias was deeply influential in the media, as people tend to read outlets based on tribal affiliations. It was also reported as having an impact on the quality of reporting. For example, journalists and editors avoiding unfavorable coverage of individuals of the same tribe, or issues as perceived as being tribal. Similarly, journalists tend to rely on sources in government who are from the same tribe. Many media respondents felt this imparted bias into coverage, but most agreed that the bias was clear (unlike political motivations, which often seem hidden).

#### Triangulating news and information from multiple platforms

An overwhelming trend amongst respondents was a reliance on multiple sources of media for information. Because they do not trust any source, Kenyans triangulate information through multiple outlets, and complement that with information provided to them through social networks, both in-person and through social media.

WhatsApp was one of the most important sources of information for many respondents. People overwhelmingly received (and shared) articles and discussed news via the messaging platform---news that comes with the imprimatur of a personal recommendation seems to be the most valued.\
Respondents also looked at newspapers, listened to the radio, and watched television for news. They accessed the internet for news through both Android phones and laptops. In addition to WhatsApp, Facebook was commonly used, although media actors and hard-core digital natives and elites tended to prefer Twitter. YouTube was popular, and many people use torrent download sites to access entertainment; others trade or buy USB and microSD pre-loaded drives to access music, western movies, or sports clips offline (and thus avoid paying for data), sometimes called "[the off-net](https://medium.com/differences-that-make-a-difference/exploring-the-off-net-898411ac374d)."

#### Relying on social media

Given Kenya's relatively high level of internet and mobile phone adoption, social media use in Kenya is a rich enough research topic to fill an entirely separate report. In relation to media accountability, Kenyans' trust in social media seems to derive from their personal connections of family and friends. Many respondents expressed a healthy understanding of the potential for misinformation online (backed by [polling data](http://blog.geopoll.com/geopoll-and-portland-launch-a-survey-report-on-fake-news-in-kenya)), although we heard anecdotes that seemed to show both sides: One respondent told us that online conversations were fast, diverse, and resilient enough to challenge rumor and fake news, and surface the truth. Another expressed the opposite opinion, calling Kenyans "uncritical," too quick to share news without evaluating it. We believe the truth is somewhere in the middle---as it is in many other countries. While it is hard to know if and how disinformation swayed people's voting preferences in the recent elections, [numerous reports](https://www.google.com/search?q=la+times+kenya+horrible+images+social+media+fake+news&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix17vtr8jWAhUGxVQKHb_bCFIQBQgjKAA&biw=1440&bih=799) have shown that online disinformation was a prominent feature of the pre- and post-election information ecosystem, such as photos depicting violence from other electoral periods circulating with falsely contemporary captions.

Broadly, people with less education and fewer resources are less able to sort through the noisy information environment online, and are more vulnerable to manipulation. Those with fewer resources are increasingly gaining access and increasingly eager to gain access; more than one respondent mentioned that young people will buy data instead of a meal when forced to choose. In low-income neighborhoods, we heard stories of neighbors setting up shared wifi networks, with users chipping in as much as they can in order to spread the costs; one respondent told us that his entire building used a single shared router.

#### Using social media to criticize media coverage

Citizens are expressing their low trust in media by commenting on news events via social media,  holding traditional media to account on low quality, shallow, biased, and even incorrect journalism. Social media is breaking news, circulating information about uncovered incidents, and providing context and detailed analysis. For example, during the time of our research, a child was killed at a campaign rally by police. When the establishment media failed to report the incident, it was circulated and discussed online.
