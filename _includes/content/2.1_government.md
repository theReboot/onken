The government is by far the media's largest and most insidious antagonist in Kenya. Since the Kenyatta administration took power in 2013, the government has targeted media actors with increasing aggressiveness, and establishment media organizations have been overwhelmingly willing to capitulate (often enriching themselves with political favors and bribes at the same time).

A number of respondents were willing to speculate about the Kenyatta administration's motivations in attacking the press. Some described the president as authoritarian by nature, while others believed he is motivated by anger over the International Criminal Court investigation, for which he blames the media and civil society. In addition, most agreed that the rampant, blatant, and accelerating corruption by the administration was motivation for dampening the press's power to stop that corruption.

[Section TK: Here, we'll include more context from the outcome of the October election. With Kenyatta, dire. With Odinga, uncertainty. I.e.: Â This is why we were disheartened when Kenyatta was declared the winner of the August 8 election.. OR, While the defeat of Kenyatta may mean there is new space for the media to stretch its muscles, Odinga's approach is uncertain... ]

Yet no matter what stance the next administration takes, the press has already been dramatically weakened by government attack, and a dangerous precedent has already been set. Citizens have little trust in media. Journalist morale is low. The government's interconnected, concerted effort has effectively declawed the media in the short term; a holistic approach will be necessary, and quickly, if the country's media is to recover.
