# Why Support Kenyan Independent Media?

Kenya's establishment media is [frequently](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7171372.stm)  [cited](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/03/terrorism-westgate-mall-press-freedom) as the strongest in East Africa, thanks to its firm foundation---including constitutional protections for freedom of the press, a broad plurality of media, and Kenyans' healthy demand for news and information. But it still faces steep challenges in achieving media's full potential as an agenda-setter and public watchdog. Long-standing political and commercial forces are threatening to undermine the media's strong foundation, and to erode the gains made through recent decades.

Right now, there is an urgent opportunity to support the brave journalists and media entrepreneurs who are committed to reversing this trend. Strengthening independent media in Kenya is vital, both to continue to set the pace for the region, and to hold government accountable through an ongoing season of political change.  

#### Reversing a decline in media support

This report is based on interviews with a variety of Kenyan media actors and other experts. Many lamented the decline in financing for independent media in recent years, which has resulted in downsized programs, staff layoffs, and closed capacity development initiatives, and which has come at a time when media and civil society are eager for innovative investment.

The explicit protections for freedom of press and expression established in the 2010 Constitution set a high bar for optimism, and have buoyed interest and innovation amongst journalists. These expectations can be fulfilled, but require new and more holistic approaches to funding and support.     

These new, holistic approaches are what we hope this report inspires. Our goal is to offer analysis and recommendations to help media entrepreneurs, journalists, donors, investors, government actors, and other stakeholders understand the systematic forces Kenyan media actors face in their important work, driving collaboration and new efforts that can strengthen the entire field.
