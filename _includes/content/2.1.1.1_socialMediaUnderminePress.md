## Social media as a tool to undermine the press

The government has become adept at using social media---to circumvent media reports and reach citizens directly, to self-promote, and to manipulate perceptions. Reportedly, the Kenyatta administration has proudly called itself a "digital government," and its corrupt practices extend to digital media. It was widely reported that the Kenyatta campaign employed Cambridge Analytica, the controversial data and anayltics firm that supported both the Trump campaign and the Brexit vote. A number of respondents reported that bloggers were paid to produce favorable content, to spread rumors, and to "troll" adversaries (through online harassment). One prominent blogger, Robert Alai, once a critic of the government, has been accused of taking money from the government in return for favorable coverage.
