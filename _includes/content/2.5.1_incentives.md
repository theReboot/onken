### Pressures & Incentives

All of the issues affecting national-level outlets described in this report are very real challenges at the local level: Media owners have political ties, outlets still rely almost exclusively on shrinking ad revenues, journalists are overstretched and under-trained, and local governments regularly interfere with and stifle the work of the press.

These constraints are amplified at the local level by competitive and contentious politics and shifting political alliances. For example, corporations almost never advertise in local media, as one respondent said "we cannot monetize the rural areas;" this means local outlets are entirely dependent on political and government advertising.

#### Closer relationship to government

In addition to being tied more closely to government financially, local media outlets are also tied more closely to government politically. A number of respondents noted that Kenyan elections are mainly decided in rural areas, where people are more likely to vote according to tribal affiliations (rather than based on a candidate's platform). This means local media are both more likely to be supportive and at the same time dependent on government largesse. Conversely, local media are more vulnerable if they offend or anger local politicians.

The potential for strong feedback loops based on media coverage is the highest at the local level---in theory, media coverage can highlight stories that directly impact citizens' lives, amplifying their concerns to smaller governments and leading to faster change in a virtuous cycle. But existing political allegiances and pressures at the local level currently make these loops fragile.

#### Competitive pressure in the wrong direction

While our research showed that urban media are often pressured to cover politically difficult stories by competition from other outlets, rural media are rarely forced to cover a story that might hurt a political ally---because they are usually the only game in town. This is especially true with radio, which is a key source of information (often in local languages) at the local level.

Similarly, while social media in urban areas is often exerting pressure by highlighting stories the media otherwise wouldn't touch, access to the internet is much lower in rural areas, with data costs less affordable, meaning the pressure from social media is significantly lower.

#### Lack of capacity and peer support

While there is little competition between outlets and mediums, there is steep competitive pressure between journalists themselves. National outlets offer small local sections, and hire freelance correspondents to cover stories. Many correspondents find themselves in a difficult fight with each other for scant jobs.

This lack of peer support is especially challenging because local journalists have almost no opportunities for external capacity development. The funding for media is heavily concentrated in Nairobi, meaning training and support opportunities are largely non-existent.
