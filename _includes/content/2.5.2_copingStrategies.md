### Media coping strategies

Despite these constraints, some independent media has emerged locally; Thikka, detailed in the case study below, is one strong example.

For many of the independent media, working closely with community-based and faith-based organizations was an effective strategy. For example, the Network of Catholic Radios workers through the catholic diocese, which has many local religious affiliates throughout communities. Because these partner organizations are rooted deeply in the grassroots, media actors reported that they can provide political cover (as well as support with producing locally relevant news).
