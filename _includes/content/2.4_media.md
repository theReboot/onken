The challenges facing the Kenyan media are largely structural. While the Kenyatta administration has been strategic in its attempts to weaken the press and silence critics, part of the blame for the success of these attacks lies in the field's inherent weakness---it is a media space dominated by a handful of large, politically connected media institutions. In addition, the changing business environment has greatly affected the Kenya media landscape; the transition to digital television in 2015, for example, upended existing business models at a time when companies were already facing intense political pressure.

In this section, we turn turn to the Media itself, through the same framework---first of pressures and incentives, created by the 'ecosystem,' then the coping strategies of individual journalists and editors.
