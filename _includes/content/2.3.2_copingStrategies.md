### How media responds

Cumulatively, through an appetite for news and information, and especially through a passion for social media, citizens in Kenya today are putting pressure on the national media industry to innovate and improve its work.

The pressure of social media, where news breaks more quickly, is also putting competitive pressure on traditional media organizations. Almost all media respondents noted that breaking news has become the domain of social media. Events that Kenya's news media would have traditionally been the first to present to the public are being "scooped" online. Without the ability to break news, journalists feel that their relevance has suffered.

As a result, social media is pushing establishment media to think more strategically about its competitive advantage in an environment where it can no longer break news. "Online is dominating breaking news. Media has become something of a curator as opposed to news breaker," said a civil society respondent working on digital policy and advocacy. Another respondent working in digital news argued that, with the loss of their breaking news function, his organization is focusing on adding value through fact-checking and more in-depth reporting to ensure news circulating online is credible.

The rise of digital has also helped to "democratize" Kenya's information ecosystem. Establishment media no longer have a monopoly on information. Some stories that might otherwise have been censored, self-censored, or ignored by the establishment media accordingly gain traction online. Researchers frequently heard that stories generating attention on social media can, in turn, compel establishment media organizations to also extend coverage. For example, in June 2017, 30 people were rushed to the hospital after a cholera outbreak at a hotel in Nairobi. Because the hotel was affiliated with a prominent politician in the Kenyatta administration, some respondents believed the outbreak would have been ignored if not for social media. (The story was eventually covered critically in establishment outlets, including [The Nation](http://www.nation.co.ke/counties/nairobi/government-apparent-attempt-cover-up-cholera-outbreak-weston/1954174-3986100-11xk3ci/index.html)). Without the presence of social media, there would be less pressure on establishment media to report on sensitive topics.

Journalists have had success publishing content digitally, circumventing the constraints of establishment media organizations, and reaching citizens directly. "Apart from expanding the democratic space, digital is also largely inexpensive to start and operate. One does not, for instance, need a lot of money to invest in the establishment of a website. In many instances, digital spaces enable the publication of public interest stories that normally will not come through mainstream media," explained an editor with The Nation. A handful of promising digital-first publications were referenced by multiple respondents as examples of the growing diversity of the media landscape. For example, [Owaahh](http://owaahh.com/) and [Gathara's Worl](https://gathara.blogspot.com/)d were cited as outlets for thoughtful reporting and analysis, and [Hivisasa](http://www.hivisasa.com/) and [The Elephant](https://www.theelephant.info/) were noted for their diversity of contributors and viewpoints. [The Reject ](http://reject.awcfs.org/)and the [Kenyan Women](http://kw.awcfs.org/), both produced by the African Women and Child Feature Service, were noted for surfacing underreported stories, with a focus on development and women's issues.

A number of media sector respondents acknowledged the importance of bloggers in covering stories censored by establishment media houses. Publishing independently online liberates journalists from the political pressures of ownership (although not government intimidation), with lower startup costs than printing a newspaper or operating a radio station.

Many outlets are struggling to adjust their business and reporting models in response to pressure from social media and online advertising. All media outlets are struggling to earn money from their websites. Online ad sales have not replaced the decline in revenue from print ad sales. And, like most media companies globally have had to contend with, audiences are increasingly accustomed to free content. Nevertheless, respondents working at establishment media houses frequently discussed the importance of having a strong digital presence, as more and more consumers come online. One respondent discussed expanding the newspaper's digital presence, and incorporating online video and interactive storytelling methods. As another example of digital innovation, a local media site, [Thika Town Today](http://www.thikatowntoday.co.ke/), uses WhatsApp and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thikatowntoday/) to connect more closely with its audiences, by crowdsourcing story ideas and facilitating conversations about local issues.
