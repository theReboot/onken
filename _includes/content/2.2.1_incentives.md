### How citizens pressure and incentive media

Our findings dramatically contradict the accepted international wisdom about Kenya. Various organizations have conducted studies and reports that describe Kenya's media as the "most trusted" institution in the country. However, our research showed that this benchmark is highly relative---Kenyans may trust the media more than they trust the government, for example, but this is a very low bar. Nearly every research respondent expressed at least some level of frustration and disgust with the media.

#### Low trust in media

Many citizens see the media as part of the country's web of corruption. Respondents were acutely aware of the political motivations of the owners of establishment media organizations (see Constituent 1). One respondent noted that it is difficult to know what stories are being left out because of these commercial and political considerations.

Tribalism is a more transparent source of bias in news outlets; as in other parts of Kenyan society, tribal bias was also reported as impacting the quality of reporting. For example, journalists and editors avoiding unfavorable coverage of individuals of the same tribe, or issues as perceived as being tribal. Journalists relying on sources in government, from example, who are from the same tribe. Many media respondents felt this imparted bias into coverage, but most agreed that the bias was clear (unlike political motivations, which often seem hidden). People tend to read outlets based on tribe.

#### Triangulating news and information from multiple platforms

This was an overwhelming trend: Respondents rely on multiple sources of media for information. Because they do not trust any source, Kenyans triangulate information through multiple outlets, and complementing that with information provided to them through social networks, whether in person conversations with family, friends, and neighbors, or through social media.

WhatsApp was one of the most important sources of information for many respondents. People overwhelmingly received (and shared) articles and discussed news via the messaging platform---news that comes with the imprimatur of a personal recommendation seems to be the most valued.

Respondents also looked at newspapers, listened to the radio, and watched television for news. They accessed the internet for news through both Android phones and laptops. In addition to WhatsApp, Facebook was commonly used, although media actors and hard-core digital natives and elites tended to prefer Twitter. YouTube was popular, and many people use torrent download sites to access entertainment; others trade or buy USB and microSD pre-loaded drives to access music, western movies, or sports clips offline (and thus avoid paying for data).

#### Relying on social media

Social media use in Kenya is a separate and rich research topic, with nuance and information to fill an entirely separate report. In relation to media accountability, it is important only to understand that Kenyans' trust in social media is based in their family and friend connections; many respondents expressed a healthy understanding of the potential for misinformation.

We heard anecdotes that seemed to show both sides: One respondent told us that online conversations were fast, diverse, and resilient enough to challenge rumor and fake news, and surface the truth. Another expressed the opposite opinion, calling Kenyans "uncritical," too quick to share news without evaluating it. We believe the truth is somewhere in the middle---as it is in many other countries. Broadly, people with less education and experience are less able to sort through the noisy information environment online, and are more vulnerable to manipulation.

Those with fewer resources are increasingly gaining access and increasingly eager to gain access; more than one respondent mentioned that young people will buy data instead of a meal when forced to choose. In low-income neighborhoods, one trend is setting up shared wifi networks, with users chipping in as much as they can in order to spread the costs, one respondent told us that his entire building shared a single shared router.

Social media is also feeding low-quality and plagiarist platforms. The website Tuko is one example raised by a respondent living in a slum, who said that "everyone" uses it; another media respondent raised this site as a negative example of copyright violation, and a media outlet with no interest in serving the public good. These kinds of sites are not widely trusted, but they do create competitive pressure for other media outlets.

#### Using social media to criticize media coverage

Citizens are expressing their low trust in media by responding in real-time to news events via social media.  Through social media, citizens are holding traditional media to account on low quality, shallow, biased, and even incorrect journalism. They are breaking news, circulating information about uncovered incidents, and providing context and detailed analysis. For example, at the time of our research, a child was killed at a campaign rally by police. The establishment media failed to report on the incident, but it was circulated and discussed online.
