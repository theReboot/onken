### Media coping strategies

For the most part, the ways that journalists and media organizations have responded to government attacks reflect the severity of those attacks. Across the board, the media industry has responded to these pressures by bending to the government's will and shrinking away from critical coverage.

-   Note: This is a difficult environment! It's difficult to blame the media for evolving strategies for coping, keeping in mind that it is difficult at this point to assess their success

-   Some courageous journalists are willing to take risks in the face of political consequences. They are finding ways to continue publishing critical coverage in at least some arenas, pushing back on government intimidation:

#### Defensive coverage

-   Journalists and editors self-censor; they have evolved a number of strategies to deal with the pressures that often result in self-censorship and poor quality reporting.

-   Many maintain an acute awareness of how powerful individuals and interests are interconnected and how a story might come back to bite, and then avoid those topics.

#### Seeping corruption

In the low pay, high pressure media environment, many respondents noted that a number of journalists and editors have accepted corrupt practices (acquiescing to a government strategy). Many respondents commented on journalists taking money to report favorably, or to omit details.

-   One respondent noted that young journalists are seeing editors driving cars far beyond their salary range, and forcing journalists to say "I want that."

-   One respondent described one government agency, which established a symbiotic relationship. The agency would provide exclusive coverage to only one publication. In return, that publication would only provide favorable coverage.

#### Standing in solidarity

-   Some journalists who feel they cannot report on particular individual or issue, will pass promising leads to colleagues who can. Others will circulate leads around to many journalists, so that coverage is more widespread---a practice that one respondent described as "spreading the risk."

-   In fact, solidarity among journalists was probably one of the most cited strategies for risk mitigation. Need examples/quotes.

#### Calling out government intimidation

-   Journalists also seek to draw public attention to the fact of government intimidation itself.

-   One journalist noted that for particularly incendiary topics, it is important to go hard, publicly naming individuals who are threatening them, while at the same time rally other journalists to stand in solidarity. Â Need an example?

[CASE STUDY]:  Need a good example here - perhaps journalists who spread the risk with a particular news tip to multiple outlets?
