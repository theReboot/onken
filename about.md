# About the Report

In the era of rapid technology expansion, rampant disinformation, and political attacks on media, there is an urgent need for resilient media to speak out against corruption, totalitarianism, and abuse of power. The research outlined in this report was commissioned by the Omidyar Network in direct response to these threats on media; our goal was to understand the current state of Kenyan media, and to identify opportunities for support.

The research took place over three weeks in July 2017, about a month prior to Kenya's general elections---a time when tension regarding the results was saturating both Kenyan minds and Kenyan media.

The research team conducted more than 65 semi-structured, in-person interviews, each lasting more than an hour. Media actors, with a wide range of profiles, represented about half of the research sample, and included experts with a long history working in establishment media organizations as well as scrappy freelancers trying to find their voice in a saturated market. The second half of the research sample consisted of citizens, civil society organizations, and government officials. Research teams spent time with actors outside of the media industry in order to gain a holistic understanding of how media currently operates and is perceived in Kenya.

The research was largely based in Kenya's capital city of Nairobi and its surrounding peri-urban areas. The capital was chosen because of its proximity to both the media industry and government actors; however, as Kenya is primarily a rural country, confining the research to Nairobi created a few constraints. For one, while the team sought to speak to a variety of actors specializing in a range of mediums (radio, television, publication, and digital), the sample has a slight leaning towards publication and digital mediums.

Beyond the scope of this research, there is much more to examine outside of Nairobi, specifically with the devolution of government powers to the county level in relative infancy. For example, vernacular radio, which primarily operates locally, is covered lightly in this research, but deserves its own study entirely. Assessing the impact of digital (or lack thereof) in suburban and rural areas is another important area for future research.

This report is meant to be a landscape analysis of media in Kenya, a broad overview, offered as a starting point for further exploration and investment. We hope the findings detailed here will inspire media actors, entrepreneurs, and others to give each constituent of the media ecosystem the scrutiny---and the support---it deserves.
