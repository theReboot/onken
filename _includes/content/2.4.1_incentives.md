### How civil society pressures and incentivizes media

There is a counterproductive gap between CSOs and media in Kenya. While CSOs are well aware of the need for media coverage to further their goals, we found very few examples of organizations exerting influence or pressure on the media. This is due to limited capacity as well as a deep mistrust, which a number of respondents noted.

#### Mistrust for journalists

CSO respondents often describe media as "lazy" and "corrupt." They perceive that journalists, accustomed to government bribes, will often ask for payment in exchange for coverage. CSOs who see themselves as mission-driven are often frustrated when they interact with journalists who seem to have other priorities; one CSO respondent noted that "media always want sensational stories, and think the development issues can wait until tomorrow." He discussed his experience with developing a regional TV show focused on budget issues, which was canceled without explanation. Bad experiences with journalists, especially at establishment media organizations, have convinced some CSOs that engagement is not worth the effort.
 
#### Facilitating human interest content for journalists

On the other hand, when CSO and media cooperate, they both seem to benefit. One freelance journalist called NGOs and CSOs "great links to story ideas." Another respondent who participated in a civil society-facilitated gender training in Mombasa described it as not only entertaining but transformational. This training successfully sparked debate, helping important gender issues resonate with the (largely male) audience by encouraging them to relate the topic to their own female family members. To this respondent, however, civil society trainings are only influential if they are compelling enough to deeply transform the way journalists think about social issues.

In another case, we heard a story of a health facility, which was put at risk due to a "land grab" by government officials. Within a few hours of hearing the news, the CSO organized a demonstration via WhatsApp with hospital patients. They simultaneously organized a press briefing in Nairobi for media. The attention successfully drew the attention of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, and within three weeks the land was returned to the health facility.
