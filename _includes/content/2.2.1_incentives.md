### How government pressures and incentivizes media

In its efforts to limit press freedom, the state has taken advantage of many tools, including, in some circumstances, violence and intimidation. In a [recent report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/30/not-worth-risk/threats-free-expression-ahead-kenyas-2017-elections), Human Rights Watch and Article 19 documented a worrying trend of journalist intimidation. However, outright violence is not as common as the more-subtle tools of economic, legal, regulatory, and political pressure.

#### Political pressure

To varying extents, many Kenyan media houses have political entanglements, which influence their independence. Every one of the major media houses in Kenya is owned by either a politician, a close party affiliate, or a business person with other commercial interests that depend on politicians' good graces.

As owners wield influence over journalists' and editors' careers, politicians have been known to work their connections, resulting in a widespread sense of insecurity among journalists and editors. Several recent, high-profile firings were cited as evidence, such as the firings of Daily Nation editor [Denis Galava](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/blow-to-kenyas-media-after-editor-sacked-for-criticising-president) and [cartoonist Gado](https://cpj.org/blog/2016/03/gado-blames-government-pressure-as-cartoonists-con.php). In the short run, these firings may have protected the Nation from additional political pressure, but these firings hurt its credibility. Addressing deficits in public trust needs to be the central thrust of any support initiative for Kenyan media.

#### Economic pressure

Government also wields economic leverage over Kenya's media. The government has historically been one of the main sources of ad revenue in the country (corporations, primarily banks and telecoms, are the other). But between 2015 and 2017 the government created the Government Advertising Agency and then consolidated all of its advertising into a single platform, called "MyGov." In some cases, this transformed the media's largest source of ad revenue from a diversified portfolio of multiple agency partnerships into a single, mostly digital source.

This consolidation has truncated media's revenue streams. It also enables the government to use advertising revenue as a negotiating chip, pushing media institutions to soften coverage or ignore certain stories. In some cases, the government is also failing to pay for ads that have already run.  

Overall, the significant decline in ad revenue has cost thousands of newsroom jobs. The political influence of advertising dollars has also extended to corporate advertisers, including banks and telecoms; a number of respondents noted that corporate interests threaten to withdraw advertising if unfavorable coverage is published or broadcast.

However, these challenges are also driving media entrepreneurs to think creatively and search for new business models. There is an opportunity to step in now to support promising efforts and encourage a shift to stronger commitment to independence that can drive government accountability in tandem with new business models.

#### Regulatory and Legal pressure

Despite constitutional press protections, the government has made some moves to manipulate the legal and regulatory environment. One example: although laws exist that designate an independent Media Council of Kenya to provide oversight, set standards, and arbitrate disputes, the government has empowered multiple, competing agencies to oversee similar media regulations. The government has also limited the Media Council's funding, and the Multimedia Tribunal, a government entity, has assumed some of the Council's authority.

Legal action by government officials against media organizations has been another strategy for attacks against the press. The threat of a lawsuit hangs over media houses; one respondent joked that journalists are trained in "how not to get sued." Fortunately, respondents generally reported faith in the independence of the courts.
