## 3. Alternative Publishing Platforms

### Fund (or establish?) alternative publishing platforms. Suggest building on successful young experiments and stand-out journalists.

#### Influence

-   Kenya lacks a truly independent media. The big five dominate the space, but they lack independence

-   Kenya desperately needs independent media, with credibility and reach to fill that void

-   This is probably the hardest to crack, but the most important

#### Opportunity Description

-   Invest in building (multiple) credible publishing platforms to free journalists from the censorship that is riff in the 'establishment media."

-   We suspect that focusing on multiple orgs with well-defined missions and niche audiences (i.e. starting small) would likely yield the most success

-   The hope

-   For national issues, this will likely have to be built from scratch

-   Success will be dependent on credibility, reach, access to audience, quality of journalism

-   Will need to be built on the reputation of known, credible journalists

-   Will need to attract truly independent and high quality, experienced journalists,

-   Resourced for an extended period of time, with enough to pay competitive wages

-   Provide cover for its journalists

#### Impact

-   This could be a game changer

-   A successful independent platform would have impact in three areas:

-   Deliver information not found on other platforms

-   Create competition for the other media houses and force them to reconsider what they refuse to publish

-   Spread the risk around so that there are now more places to publish on sensitive issues

#### Level of Effort

-   Building a credible platform would require significant resources, time and expertise

-   Large bets with long return.

-   Cannot start from scratch; needs to build on existing excitement/talent. Many in the past have failed trying to fund non-starters.

#### Other Considerations

-   A successful alternative would no doubt attract the anger of the government, who would seek strategies to undermine it

-   Strong partnerships and networks would be critical for risk mitigation

-   It may be possible to find local outlets that already exist, but we would need to do additional scoping outside of Nairobi.
