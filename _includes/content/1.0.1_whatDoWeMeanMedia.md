### What do we mean by "media"?

As a broad landscape assessment, this report does not discuss granular differences between types of media outlets. But it does distinguish between **establishment media organizations**, which are well-established, large companies controlling national, regional, and local print, radio, television, and digital outlets, and **independent media organizations**, which are less impacted by the structural and political influences that limit mediaâ€™s independence, and which are in critical need of financial and technical support to remain independent.
