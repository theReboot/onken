Like the media, Kenyan civil society has a history and reputation for being relatively robust and professional. Also like the media, civil society is working in a shrinking civic space, with decreasing support from donors and under pressure from the Jubilee administration. For example, after the August 8, 2017 election, Kenya's NGO regulator [attempted to shut down](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/08/kenya-attempts-to-shut-down-human-rights-groups-unlawful-and-irresponsible/) two human rights organizations involved in election monitoring.

In any context, civil society and media collaborations can create exponential benefits in increased transparency and accountability. In Kenya, there is an opportunity to increase trust and familiarity between these sectors, highlighting their similar challenges---and their aligned governance goals---and encouraging new partnerships.

We define civil society organizations (CSOs) broadly in this report, encompassing community-based organizations, religious organizations, and other non-governmental and non-commercial groups.
