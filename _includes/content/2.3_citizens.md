Citizen demand for news may be one of the Kenyan media's greatest advantages, as it suggests high growth potential. Kenyans consume a large quantity and wide variety of information and media. However, no single outlet is well-positioned to meet Kenyans' needs for a reliable, independent news source that they feel they can trust.

In urban areas (where this research focused), Kenyans tend to be highly engaged in politics. However, our research indicated an emerging gap between younger and older generations, as younger Kenyans especially seemed tired of the endless parade of corruption scandals; many were uninterested in discussing governance issues. These respondents tended to consume media more for entertainment than information. Kenya is a young country, and projected to stay so for quite some time. Almost [three-quarters of the population is under 30](https://www.census.gov/population/international/files/at/AGTRNDKE.pdf); with a median age of fourteen, this growing generation is an important target for the media to reach and build trust for the long-term.
