# The Accountability Ecosystem in Kenya Today

Understanding the current Kenyan media landscape requires first looking at each of the main constituents that interact with the media and its work for accountability: Government, Citizens, and CSOs.

This page focuses on each of these constituents in turn, exploring the "pressures and incentives" they create for media actors. The media's current practices and outputs are largely in response to these pressures and incentives; some of these "coping strategies" lead to the kind of robust, critical, and strategic journalism that most effective drives accountability, but most lead in the opposite direction. To evaluate coping mechanisms quantitatively, we have given each a score of XXXXX using the Free and Fair Standard XXX.

In the final section of this page, we will turn to the Media itself, building on all previous findings. Following the same framework, we will explore the constraints created by the industry itself: The pressures and incentives media actors experience due to the structure and culture of the field, as well as the strategies that individual journalists and editors use to cope.

Donors reading this page will gain a systems-level view of the current media ecosystem. This will help donors understand their own position---as constituents of the media ecosystem themselves---whose interventions create further pressures and incentives and inspire coping mechanisms. By understanding current dynamics and constraints, donors will be better able to target their investments to complement positive coping mechanisms, counter negative ones, and pinpoint the most effective places to adjust the entire system to greater accountability.
