### The Influence of Ethnicity

Ethnicity is a powerful and sometimes divisive force in Kenya. Politicians at every level of government have used ethnic allegiances as a tool to mobilize support. Just as ethnic identity is woven into Kenyan society and politics, it too is woven into Kenyan media. It is reflected in both the decisions about which stories to cover and how to cover them, as well as how audiences perceive ethnic bias in reporting. Most citizen respondents perceived that establishment media companies were more sympathetic towards particular ethnic groups. Editors interviewed were acutely aware of this perception, and confirmed that ethnic bias does occasionally affect reporting.
