## About this Report

This report was commissioned by Omidyar Network to understand the current state of Kenyan media, and to identify opportunities to support independent media.

It is meant to be a starting point for further exploration and investment. We hope the findings detailed here will inspire media actors, entrepreneurs, and others to give the Kenyan media ecosystem the critical attention---and the support---needed to flourish.

#### A note about the 2017 presidential elections

In the time since this report was written, Kenya's media has faced significant challenges in covering the country's extended election period, including the virtually unprecedented second presidential election on October 26, 2017. We have decided to limit discussion of the election because it would be based on second-hand information as opposed to primary interviews, which form the basis for this report. The dynamics and opportunities described in this report run more deeply than current electoral politics, and are likely to persist through ongoing political changes. Â 

#### How this research was conducted

Our team conducted research and interviews over the course of three weeks in July 2017; we completed more than 65 semi-structured, in-person interviews, each lasting more than an hour. Media actors with a wide range of profiles represented about half of the respondents; they included experts with a long history working in establishment media organizations as well as freelancers trying to find their voice in a competitive market. The second half of respondents consisted of citizens, civil society organizations, and government officials. Our team spent time with these non-industry actors in order to gain a holistic understanding of how media currently operates and is perceived in Kenya.

#### Limitations due to geographic focus

The research was based in Kenya's capital city of Nairobi and its surrounding peri-urban areas. The capital was chosen because of its proximity to both the media industry and government actors; however, as Kenya is primarily a rural country, confining the research to Nairobi created a few constraints. For one, while the team sought to speak to a variety of actors specializing in a range of mediums (radio, television, publication, and digital), the sample has a slight leaning towards published and digital mediums.

Beyond the scope of this research, there is much more to examine outside of Nairobi, specifically with the devolution of government powers to the county level (a power structure that is still in relative infancy). For example, vernacular radio, which primarily operates locally, is not covered in this research. Assessing the impact of digital media in suburban and rural areas is another important area for future research, since, overall, most Kenyans do not have the same access as those in urban areas.
