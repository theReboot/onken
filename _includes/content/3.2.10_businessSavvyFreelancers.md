### 10. Business Savvy Freelancers

### Training freelance journalists and bloggers in legal issues, business skills, and other tangential skills can elevate their work within the current field constraints.

#### Opportunity

Barring a shift in the structure of the field, the trend toward freelance journalism---partly a response to the mass firing of newsroom staffers---is going to continue. To succeed as independent journalists, and to resist the pressures of corruption, these professionals can benefit from new skills that go beyond writing and reporting. Donors can meet this demand by offering trainings on complementary skills, such as business training and legal aid as well as video and audio production, data journalism, etc.   

#### Impact

Over the long term, expanded business skillsets may help foster innovation, as journalists may see new opportunities to create digital or other new platforms and build competitive media outlets on their own. Similarly, legal trainings can help journalists and bloggers protect themselves against a powerful line of government attack.

#### Level of Effort

Effort will need to be exerted in the design of the trainings to ensure they meet the explicit demands of journalists, as well as providing sustained support post-training to help make the most of this investment.
