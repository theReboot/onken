### 8. Physical Spaces for Independent Journalists

### Opening spaces for independent journalists to gather, access the internet, and seek mentorship will provide physical security as well as professional support.  

#### Opportunity

To address resource and skill gaps, particularly for young and freelance journalists, donors may provide physical spaces where journalists can access desks, internet, computers, and phone lines. They could also be staffed with experienced journalists to provide guidance and mentorship, which numerous respondents felt is essential to the professional growth of aspiring journalists. Internews, the Kenyan Correspondents Association, and the Association of Freelance Journalists have all had (or are currently running) similar initiatives. However, many of these "safe spaces" have been closed due to a lack of funding, which multiple respondents who used these spaces lamented. Researchers heard stories of journalists who were attacked in internet cafés, because they did not have dedicated safe locations to work from.

These spaces have been implemented before, and so their moderate impact is fairly well known. Still, demand exists for more. Additionally, these hubs will likely provide the added benefit of creating and strengthening relationships amongst journalists, who can support each other more effectively if they are in frequent contact.
