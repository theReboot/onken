### Media coping strategies (individual)

Journalists work within an increasingly precarious field. We met many courageous and capable journalists who are committed to their role in the public interest, but are hamstrung by political and economic forces. Â They have a clear understanding of the media's role in society and a desire to work for the public good, although many acknowledged that they struggle to fulfill these ambitions.

We also spoke to a number of media actors, and heard stories of many more, who have capitulated to the pressure. They are:

As a result, quality and in-depth reporting is more rare; many journalists favor the easier routes of parroting press releases, or focusing their articles as "he said, she said," both strategies we heard from a number of respondents. This is also the result of the dismantling of investigative units as well as lack of resources for in-depth journalism.
