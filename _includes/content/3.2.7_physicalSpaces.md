### 7. Physical Spaces for Independent Journalists

### Opening spaces for independent journalists to gather, access the internet, and seek mentorship will provide physical security as well as professional support.  

#### Opportunity

To address resource and skills gaps, particularly for young and freelance journalists, donors may provide physical space where journalists can access the internet, computers, phone lines, and mentorship. Internews, the Kenyan Correspondents Association, and Association of Freelance Journalists all have had (or are currently running) something like this; numerous respondents lamented the closing of many such "safe spaces." While improved access to the internet has helped many journalists---seemingly making these internet access spaces less useful---we frequently heard that a physical place to work is important. As we also heard at least one story of a journalist who was attacked in an internet café, these work spaces can provide a measure of security as well.

#### Impact

These spaces have been implemented before, and so their moderate impact is predictable. However, research shows that there is demand. Additionally, these hubs will likely provide the added benefit of creating and strengthening relationships amongst journalists, who can support each other more effectively if they see each other more regularly. These networks can be valuable for identifying promising independent journalists for other initiatives as well.
