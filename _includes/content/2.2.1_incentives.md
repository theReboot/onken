### Pressures and incentives on media

The accountability ecosystem in Kenya has functioned so poorly for so long, most Kenyans do not see another possibility. There is widespread frustration with---and hopelessness about---corruption. Kenyans don't see a path to good governance, and especially not through media transparency.

#### Low trust in media

Many citizens see corruption as extending directly to the media.

-   Respondents were acutely aware of the ownership of the media, described in Pillar 1. As one respondent noted, it is difficult to know what stories are being left out because of these commercial and political considerations.

-   There was an overwhelming sense that many forces are leading to bias and censorship in the media. Trust in media is very low.

-   TK - Need something about how citizens look at media through a tribal lens (as with everything; we reference tribalism earlier so this doesn't need to be completist).

-   Like other parts of Kenyan society, tribal bias was also reported as impacting the quality of reporting. For example, journalists and editors avoiding unfavorable coverage of individuals of the same tribe, or issues as perceived as being tribal. Journalists relying on sources in government, from example, who are from the same tribe.

-   Many media respondents felt this imparted bias into coverage

#### Triangulating news and information from multiple platforms

This was an overwhelming trend: Respondents rely on multiple sources of media for information. They are triangulating their sources, and complementing that with information provided to them through social networks, whether in person conversations with family, friends, and neighbors, or through social media.

-   Many people looked at the papers, listened to the radio, and watched TV. They were also connected to the internet through both Android phones and laptops.

-   Online, they're using: (Facebook most widely cited. Twitter more important for media actors and hard-core digital natives. YouTube popular for entertainment, as well as torrent download sites. Instagram was also mentioned, although far less frequently. People use WhatsApp (and Telegram) for info and to stay connected. Some even access content via USB and microSD, which is loaded, often with music, western movies, or sports clips, which can be accessed offline (this frees them from the costs of data, which can be a burden for low-income people.)

#### Relying on social media

Citizens rely on and trust social media a lot! Â This is a research topic in itself. But a number of respondents noted that they trust social media because it is composed of their family and friends.

-   Access to the internet is a huge driving trend right now, including among low income people. Anecdotally, some respondents mentioned the propensity of young people to prioritize "bundles", data packages for mobile phones, over a meal. Other strategies included some setting up a wifi network to be shared by many people, with users chipping in as the can, to spread the cost. Need details on wifi access/description?

-   While this behavior in part is part of a larger global trend away from traditional sources of information, for those who were interested in politics and governance issues, this also seemed to a be a strategy to address weakness in the traditional and mainstream media.

-   Note that rumors are a risk here. Interestingly, at least one respondent deeply involved in online conversations, felt that these networks were fast, diverse, and resilient enough to challenge rumor and fake news, and surface the truth. Other respondents commented on the how "uncritical" Kenyans were, and were quick to share without evaluating.

-   There is no doubt that social media is susceptible to rumor, and the amplification of rumor, as well as the echo chamber effect. One respondent offered examples of what they termed "disinformation for good"

-   The red number - Need details

-   Maina running for female MP - Need details

-   Some online platforms are capturing attention with low-quality and plagiarized content.

-   For example, one respondent, a student from a slum, said "everyone uses Tuko."

-   A quick analysis of the site reveals stories of dubious quality and truthfulness. One media respondent also expressed disdain for this site, which violates copyrights and has no interest in serving the public good. Fortunately, at least some young people we spoke with were able to quickly dismiss Tuko as a tabloid.

-   But there is competitive pressure from these bad sites.

#### Using social media to criticize media coverage

Citizens are expressing their low trust in media by responding in real-time to news events via social media. Through social media, citizens are traditional media to account on low quality, shallow, biased, and even incorrect journalism. Need an example here?
