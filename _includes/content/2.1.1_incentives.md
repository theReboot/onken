### Pressures and incentives (structural)

Across all mediums, most media companies have struggled to find appropriate business models for a changing economic environment. As a consequence, leading companies have radically downsized over the past eighteen months. Nations Media Group, for instance, [closed two FM radio station](https://twitter.com/NationMediaGrp/status/748393955688128516/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.africanews.com%2F2016%2F06%2F30%2Fkenya-s-nation-media-group-shuts-down-tv-and-radio-stations%2F) (opting for an online stream) and consolidated two television stations into one.

#### Declining revenue, low morale

These financial troubles have led to dramatic changes in newsrooms over the last five-to-ten years. While capacity, ethics, and pay are perennial issues for media around the world, research respondents reported a noticeable decline in the quality of reporting and the capacity of journalists in Kenya.

The withdrawal of government advertising revenue was regularly cited as leading to the loss of thousands of jobs. For example, as part of a major restructuring, respondents reported that the Standard had laid off 1,500 people. Newsrooms have become increasingly dependent on freelancers and correspondents, who, without steady work and the backing of an institution, are more vulnerable to intimidation or cooptation. More than one respondent noted that this has resulted in the "juniorisation" of the newsroom, which extends to editors as well. Without resources, mentorship, or professional support, young journalists are thrown into the deep end; all journalists are overstretched, as fewer staff are responsible for producing more content (and across multiple platforms). These forces, in turn, hurt the quality of reporting, prevent investigative journalism, and increase incentives for "pay-to-play" journalism.

#### Training is insufficient

While there are many talented and professional journalists in Kenya, broadly speaking, capacity is such an issue that it came up in every conversation with journalists, editors, media experts, and civil society groups. The previous culture of mentorship amongst journalists has mostly disappeared. Many respondents also criticized the education system, saying young journalists are not leaving school with the hands-on skills they need to succeed in the newsroom. Many journalists lack the ability, let alone the time, to fact check or even do basic background research.

In response to these low capabilities, and to achieve quality standards needed to accredit journalists, the Media Council of Kenya (among other groups) operates a number of trainings (but some respondents said this distracts the organization from its real responsibility of regulating the industry).

International organizations and civil society also have tried to fill this gap.  A few international NGOS are providing mentorship and training; at least a few respondents referred to journalists as "overtrained," even though capacity remains an issue. These trainings, often referred to as "helicopter trainings," seemed to be designed based on donor goals, rather than an authentic understanding of journalists' needs. As a result, despite regular trainings and multiple college communications programs, newsrooms continue to lack the skilled and capable journalists needed to produce high quality content.

#### Stark gender imbalance

The media must represent the people it serves---including in gender makeup. Female readers and viewers are a massive market for Kenyan media, with potential for growth. One editor noted that at his newspaper, male readership is 70 percent, which suggests growth potential with female readers.

But while there are many women who want to be journalists, they are largely underrepresented in the field. A number of respondents noted that Kenyan communication and journalism schools are flush with aspiring female journalists, in some cases outnumbering male students. But newsrooms are still heavily male dominated. This is consistent with research in 2015 by the Media Council of Kenya, which examined 912 news articles and found only [7 percent were written by women](http://www.daogewe.org/index.php/publications/reports/34-the-gender-agenda-assessing-gender-issues-in-the-media/file). During our research, we struggled to achieve gender balance in our respondents, due to the lopsided makeup of the field.

A number of respondents described the prevalence of sexual harassment of young female journalists in newsrooms (which compounds a well-documented, [global trend](https://ijnet.org/en/blog/how-newsrooms-can-fight-online-harassment-targeting-female-journalists) of online harassment toward female journalists). This has serious long-term negative consequences, as harassment narrows the pipeline of female journalists rising through the ranks of media.
