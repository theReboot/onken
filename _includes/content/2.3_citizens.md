Citizen demand for news may be one of the Kenyan media's greatest advantages. Kenyans consume a large quantity and wide variety of information and media, creating high growth potential for new media innovations.

In urban areas, Kenyans tend to be highly engaged in politics. However, amongst our respondents, there was an emerging gap between younger and older generations: younger Kenyans were uninterested in discussing governance issues, and tended to consume media more for entertainment than information. Kenya is a young country (almost [three-quarters of the population is under 30](https://www.census.gov/population/international/files/at/AGTRNDKE.pdf)), meaning this growing generation is an important potential audience.
