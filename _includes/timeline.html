        <p>Opening the airwaves had mixed effects. With this era came a mushrooming of local language FM radio stations throughout country. These local stations expanded access to media content and played an important role in political and developmental mobilization at the grassroots.</p>
        <p>But as regulations were loosened, political interests sought claim to radio frequencies and foreign entertainment flooded in—as it was cheaper than producing locally. Both of these effects have had long-lasting structural consequences for media ownership and investment in Kenya.</p>

        <p>The Kenya  Information and communication (Amendment) Act 2013 has given the state latitude to control the media landscape. Some of its provisions negate aspects of the 2010 Constitution on press freedom and freedom of the media. Specifically, the KICA law provides for the establishment of regulatory institutions such as the Communications Authority on whose board the state is heavily represented.Among other roles, the CA’s responsibilities include administering the broadcast content aspects of the Act, developing media standards for the broadcasting sector and regulating and monitoring compliance with those standards.</p>
