# The Accountability Ecosystem in Kenya Today

To understand the current landscape of Kenyan media, it is useful to look at each of the main constituents that interact with the media's accountability efforts: Government, Citizens, and CSOs.

-   This section presents a deep dive with each of those constituents. Â 

-   We will look at the "pressures and incentives" that each group exerts on the media.

-   Also look at the "coping strategies" that media use to respond to these pressures---some of which lead to good journalism, some of which lead to bad journalism.

We will then explore the Media itself through this same framework:

-   Looking first at the structural pressures and incentives the field creates for media actors.

-   Looking then at the coping strategies that individual journalists and editors use to deal.

Donor interventions create new pressures and incentives, which will either complement or counteract those of the existing ecosystem.

-   That's why it's useful to look at the findings this way!
