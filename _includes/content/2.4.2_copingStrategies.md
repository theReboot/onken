### Media coping strategies (individual)

Journalists are work within an increasingly precarious field. We met many courageous and capable journalists who are committed to their role in the public interest, but are hamstrung by political and economic forces. They have a clear understanding of the media's role in society and a desire to work for the public good. But many acknowledged that they struggled to fulfill these roles, due to the pressure. The following coping strategies do not necessarily lead to positive outcomes for public interest journalism, but they are the result of conscious actors responding to nearly insurmountable circumstances.

#### Lightweight reporting

As a result, quality and in-depth reporting is more rare; many journalists favor the easier routes of parroting press releases, or focusing their articles as "he said, she said," both strategies we heard from a number of respondents.

Are there more coping strategies? Many have been covered in previous sections - perhaps a recap here?
