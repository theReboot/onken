### Pressures and incentives (structural)

#### Declining revenue, low morale

A number of respondents noted the dramatic change in newsrooms over the last five to ten years. While capacity, ethics, and pay are perennial issues for many in media around the world, the profession as a whole in Kenya has suffered a noticeable decline, due to the economic pressures and government attacks.

-   The withdrawal of government advertising revenue was regularly cited as leading to the loss of thousands of jobs. [Quote/example]. For example, the researchers heard that the Standard had laid off 1,500 people due to restructuring.

-   Newsrooms become increasingly dependent on freelancers, who, without steady work and the backing of an institution, are more vulnerable to intimidation or cooptation. One respondent noted that this has resulted in the "juniorisation" of the newsroom, which extends to editors as well.

-   There are no resources to provide mentorship and support for young journalists, who are thrown right into the deep. And fewer journalists are responsible for producing more content, and working across multiple platforms to keep up with social media.

-   The standards of ethics have degraded. [Quote/example].

-   Morale is low. [Quote/example].

#### Stark gender imbalance

The media must represent the people it serves---including in gender makeup. But while there are many women who want to be journalists, the field often shuts them out.

-   A number of our respondents noted that the many communication and journalism schools in the country are flush with aspiring female journalists. In some cases, it was noted that they outnumber men. But newsrooms are still heavily male dominated.

-   There are only 3 female editors at XX, one of Kenya's leading outlets.

-   Our research struggled to achieve gender balance in respondents, which we suspect is due to the lopsided makeup of the field.

-   Respondents were willing to speculate about the imbalance, attributing it to society-wide asymmetries in gender power among other things. It is important to note that a number of respondents noted intense sexual harassment of young female journalists, which is likely in addition to a world-wide trend of online harassment and threats toward female journalists. The cumulative result is that young women are being forced out of newsrooms.

-   This has serious long-term negative consequences, as media needs a pipeline of female journalists rising through the ranks of media in order to balance the field.

-   Female readers and viewers are a massive market for Kenyan media, with potential for huge growth. One editor noted that at his newspaper, male readership is 70 percent, which leaves great potential growth (considering fifty percent of the country is female).

#### Training is insufficient

There are of course many smart, talented, ethical, and professional journalists in Kenya. But broadly, capacity is such an issue that it came up in every conversation with journalists, editors, media experts, and civil society groups. Many respondents criticized the education system, saying young journalists are not leaving their communication schools with the skills and education they need to succeed in the newsroom---even though journalists are required by law? to have journalism or communication degrees.

-   Note, this requirement was pushed by the newspaper owners, so that, as one respondent noted, they don't need to do training themselves.

-   Many journalists lack the ability to fact check and even do basic background research. Respondents jokingly noted that they only training they ever received at their respective news organizations was on libel laws, to try to avoid the media house from getting sued, as happens from time to time.

Donor trainings and civil society have tried to fill this gap.

-   One news organization? is sending students for an additional year of training; some international NGOS are providing mentorship and training.

-   At least a few respondents referred to journalists as "overtrained."

-   Details needed about helicopter trainings, and

-   Bottom line: Capacity gap is structural, trainings are not enough to overcome economic, political, other concerns.
