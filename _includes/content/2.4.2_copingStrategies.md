### Media coping strategies (individual)

Journalists are work within an increasingly precarious field. We met many courageous and capable journalists who are committed to their role in the public interest, but are hamstrung by political and economic forces. They have a clear understanding of the media's role in society and a desire to work for the public good. But many acknowledged that they struggled to fulfill these roles, due to the pressure.

-   Given the dramatically different context, particularly in rural areas, additional research is much needed.

-   Nevertheless, we present here key themes that emerged; these are specific to the local media landscape.  

-   These factors are also at play locally. Here, we present additional challenges faced in this particular realm:
