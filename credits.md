### Acknowledgements

Reboot is grateful to all of those who were involved in the design, research, and production of this project.

First and foremost, we want to thank all of the respondents, who were willing to take the time from their busy days to speak candidly about Kenyan media. From the taxi drivers who we spoke with as we rode around in their cars, to the University of Nairobi students who sat and chatted with us on the university quad, they helped us understand what it is like to be a media consumer in Kenya.  To the many dedicated journalists, editors, and civil society members who we met in their offices, at cafes, and in hotels--wherever we could carve out a quiet place to sit and discuss--they helped illuminate the complex dynamics  that bolster and constrain Kenya's media.

Likewise, we want to thank our researchers, Wilson Ugangu and Winnie Kammu. This research would not have been possible without them. They handled the long days and piles of sticky notes with grace and ease, all the while finding the right people to speak with and contributing thoughtful, nuanced context and analysis. Perhaps, more importantly, they were welcoming hosts and great company!

Thank you as well to Peter Okongo, Anthony Walfula, and William Janak Oloo, who all provided helpful comments on early drafts of the report, and to the 25 journalists, editors, civil society members, and academics who came to our event in January to provide additional feedback on the research. Our report is better because of all their efforts.

Finally, we would like to thank Ory Okolloh and Wendy Trott of Omidyar Network for their guidance, feedback, and patience.
