### The Influence of Ethnicity

Ethnic alliances are a powerful and sometimes divisive force in Kenya. Elections are often decided along ethnic lines, and politicians at every level of government in Kenya have used ethnic bias and allegiance as an integral tool in a patronage politics system. Just as ethnic identity is woven into Kenyan society and politics, these divisions are an intrinsic factor in Kenya's media, both in reporting and audience interpretation---a point that was made by a majority of our media respondents.

Because political and ethnic allegiance are closely intertwined, political influence over establishment media houses includes ethnic bias. Similarly, the public's trust in a media outlet is often tied to the outlet's perceived ethno-national agenda.

Ethnicity touches every aspect of life in Kenya; while this research does not deeply explore ethnicity, all findings should be interpreted in the context of this pervasive influence.
