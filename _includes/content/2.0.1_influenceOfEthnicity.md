### The Influence of Ethnicity

Ethnicity is a powerful and sometimes divisive force in Kenya. Politicians at every level of government in Kenya have used ethnic allegiances as a tool to mobilize support. Just as ethnic identity is woven into Kenyan society and politics, it is an intrinsic factor in Kenya's media, both in reporting and audience interpretation.

Because political and ethnic allegiance are closely intertwined, the public's trust in a media outlet is often tied to the outlet's perceived ethno-national agenda. While this report does not deeply explore ethnicity, media supporters should keep this influence in mind.
