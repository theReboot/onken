### 7. Connecting Journalists and CSOs

### Institutionalizing networks of trust and collaboration between CSOs and journalists can accelerate and amplify the efforts of each.

#### Opportunity

The vital relationships between media and civil society can be strengthened to the benefit of both sectors, and governance at large. Institutionalizing these relationships can encourage more collaboration, and should take many forms. We suggest a series of events designed to build networks between the two fields as a first step. These events would be aimed at helping journalist and civil society representatives to understand each other's goals, challenges, and resources. They would help civil society understand how to better frame and pitch ideas to journalists for coverage. For journalists, these events could be focused on helping them work with civil society to identify story ideas and access civil society expertise to improve the quality of their reporting.

These stronger relationships, in turn, would help increase the impact of both CSOs and media organizations. The former would be able to amplify their messages and work, reaching new audiences for advocacy and action. For journalists, CSOs can be highly valuable in contributing expertise and information, as well as in making connections to human interest stories.
