### What do we mean by "media"?

As a broad landscape assessment, this report will not discuss granular differences between media outlets. But we will distinguish between **establishment media organizations**, which in Kenya have political entanglements that hurt their independence and which control national, regional, and local print, radio, television, and digital outlets, from **independent media organizations**, which are largely non-existent in Kenya, aside from a few individual journalists and smaller organizations and which are in critical need of financial and technical support to remain independent.
