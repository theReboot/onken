### How media responds

Cumulatively, through an appetite for news and information and especially through a passion for social media, citizens in Kenya today are putting pressure on the national media industry to innovate and improve its work.

Recognizing that the public consumes a wide variety of media, many establishment outlets have struggled to identify and stick to a specific market or target audience. Instead, as one respondent told us, establishment media is "trying to be everything to everybody." This not only discourages loyal followers, but undermines an outlet's credibility, as scandal-driven coverage appears alongside serious information in the public interest. In [previous research](http://westafricamedia.reboot.org/), Reboot found that online outlets in Nigeria which similarly sought to "be everything to everybody" failed to build loyal audiences.

There is a need for greater tools that enable media to identify and understand its audiences. A group of students interviewed were frustrated with media's failure to cover topics they were interested in, such as technology and innovation (some respondents complained that traditional media houses erroneously assume young people want only tabloids and gossip). This appetite for more diverse and niche media is a rich opportunity for potential new platforms and innovations.

The pressure of social media, where news breaks more quickly, is also putting competitive pressure on editors and journalists. Almost all media respondents noted that breaking news has become the domain of social media, and some stories that might otherwise have been censored, self-censored, or ignored by the establishment media gain traction online.

For example, in June 2017, 30 people were rushed to the hospital after a cholera outbreak at a hotel in Nairobi. Because the hotel was affiliated with a prominent politician in the Kenyatta administration, some respondents believed the outbreak would have been ignored if not for social media (the story was eventually covered critically in establishment outlets, including [The Nation](http://www.nation.co.ke/counties/nairobi/government-apparent-attempt-cover-up-cholera-outbreak-weston/1954174-3986100-11xk3ci/index.html)).

Social media is also pushing establishment media to think more strategically about its competitive advantage in an environment where it can no longer break news. At least one respondent working in digital news argued that his organization added value by taking the time to fact check and clarify issues. Media entrepreneurs and supporters have a unique opportunity to leverage the pressure social media has brought on Kenya's media to incentivize innovation and support in-depth investigative journalism.

<!-- #### Shifting to digital platforms -->

A few journalists have had success publishing content digitally, circumventing the constraints of establishment media organizations and reaching citizens directly through social media. Common platforms are personal websites, Facebook, and YouTube. A few of these journalists have been able to build sizeable followings, often through publishing news analysis (rather than investigative journalism or news coverage). For example, [Owaahh](http://owaahh.com/) and [Gathara's Worl](https://gathara.blogspot.com/)d as well as [Hivisasa](http://www.hivisasa.com/) and [The Elephant](https://www.theelephant.info/) were online-first publishers cited in research.

A number of media sector respondents acknowledged the importance of bloggers specifically for their ability to cover stories censored by establishment media houses. Publishing online liberates journalists from the political pressures of ownership (although not government intimidation). While it is difficult to sustain financially, publishing online also connects journalists more closely to citizen voices, as they are interacting in real-time online, which has the potential to establish a positive feedback loop. Given the many advantages of digital publications ( despite their many limitations), creating new and bolstering existing online publishing platforms is a central component of any holistic support initiative for Kenyan media.

Many outlets are struggling to catch up to the digital age of media. Some establishment media houses have digital and print editors who feel they must compete with each other for an audience. Others report having negotiated a single editorial strategy across print and digital. All media outlets are struggling to monetize their digital content. Nevertheless, respondents working at establishment media houses frequently discussed the importance of digital work, as more and more consumers come online. One respondent discussed expanding the newspaper's online presence, incorporating online video and interactive storytelling methods.
