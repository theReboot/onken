## 14. Spaces for Equipment Access

### Need: The growing number of freelancers, correspondents and independent journalists need physical spaces to gather, work, access internet, and mentor.

#### Influence and Opportunity Description

-   To address resource and skills gaps, particularly for young and freelance journalists, provide physical space where journalists can access the internet, computers, phone lines, mentorship

-   Recognizes that more and more journalists are no longer employees of media organizations

-   Internews, the Kenyan Correspondents Association, and Association of Freelance Journalists all have or are currently running something like this

-   Numerous respondents lamented the closing of these spaces, which was attributed to funding

-   KCA rep noted that improved access to the internet has helped many journalists, but we frequently heard about the importance of a place for journalists to work

#### Impact

-   Not a game changer

-   But there seems to be demand

-   And it benefits those mainly independent and freelance journalists

-   These hubs could also help serve as locusts to strengthen journalist networks and a way to identify promising independent journalists

#### Level of Effort

-   Depends on how many and what kind of services we provide

#### Other Considerations/Risk
