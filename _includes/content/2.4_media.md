## Constituent 4: Media

The challenges facing the Kenyan media are structural. While the Kenyatta administration has been strategic in its attempts to weaken the press and silence critics, part of the blame for the success of these attacks lies in the field's inherent weakness---it is a media space dominated by a handful of large, politically connected media institutions.

In this section, as we turn to look at the media themselves, in the context of the previous findings, understanding that the pressures from the other three constituents are taking advantage of the field's inherent, structural weaknesses. We will explore the Media through the same framework--first of pressures and incentives, created by the field, then the coping strategies of individual journalists and editors.
