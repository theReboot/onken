### How government pressures and incentivizes media

In its multi-pronged attack on press freedom, the Kenyatta administration has taken advantage of many tools to weaken the media---including, in some circumstances, violence and intimidation. In a [recent report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/30/not-worth-risk/threats-free-expression-ahead-kenyas-2017-elections), Human Rights Watch and Article 19 documented a worrying recent trend in journalist intimidation; however, outright violence is not as common as the more-subtle (but no less powerful) tools of economic and political pressure, as well as legal and regulatory attacks.

#### Political pressure

Perhaps one of the Kenyan media's greatest structural challenges to independence is its entrenched political entanglements. Every major media house in Kenya is owned by either a politician, a close party affiliate, or a business person with other commercial interests that depend on politicians' good graces.

Owners wield immense influence over coverage, and over journalists' and editors' careers. This influence is often explicit, as politicians work their connections to have "troublesome" journalists and editors fired. As a result, respondents reported a widespread sense of insecurity amongst journalists. Several recent, high-profile firings were cited as evidence of the danger of rocking the boat, most frequently the firings of of Daily Nation [editor Dennis Galava](https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/01/20/nation-fires-editor-galava-over-editorial-criticising-uhuru_c1280305) and [cartoonist Gado](https://cpj.org/blog/2016/03/gado-blames-government-pressure-as-cartoonists-con.php).

#### Economic pressure

In addition to the pressure government brings to bear through ownership networks, it also wields tremendous economic leverage over establishment media. The government has historically been one of the main sources of ad revenue in the country (corporations, primarily banks and telecoms, are the other). But between 2015-2017, the government created the Government Advertising Agency and consolidated all of its advertising into a single platform, called "MyGov." In some cases, this transformed the media's largest source of ad revenue from a diversified portfolio of multiple agency partnerships into a single, mostly digital source.

This consolidation has severely limited revenue streams for establishment media houses. The government now uses advertising revenue as bait, pushing media institutions to soften coverage or ignore certain stories. In some cases, the government is also failing to pay for ads that have already run.

The result has been a significant decline in ad revenue, costing thousands of newsroom jobs. The political influence of advertising dollars has also extended to corporate advertisers, including banks and telecoms; a number of respondents noted that corporate interests are not shy about threatening to withdraw advertising if unfavorable coverage is published or broadcast.

#### Regulatory and Legal pressure

Despite constitutional press protections, respondents noted that the government is successfully manipulating the legal and regulatory environment to intimidate journalists.

One example: Despite laws designating an independent Media Council of Kenya to provide oversight, set standards, and arbitrate disputes, the government has empowered multiple, competing agencies to regulate and fine media actors. The government is reportedly not fond of the Media Council's autonomy, and has in turn limited its funding. The Multimedia Tribunal, which is part of the government, has assumed some of the Council's authority.

Legal action by government officials against media organizations has been another strategy for press attacks. Respondents did report faith in the independence of the courts; one respondent noted that the outcome of a libel case likely depends on an individual judge. Still, successful libel suits can be financially devastating, especially for independent journalists. And the threat of lawsuit seems to be a common excuse for media houses; one respondent joked that the only training journalists receive on the job is "how not to get sued."
