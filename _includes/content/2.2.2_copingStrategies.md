### Media coping strategies

Cumulatively, through an appetite for news and information and especially through a passion for social media, citizens in Kenya today are putting pressure on the media industry to innovate and improve its work.

#### "Trying to be everything to everyone"

Recognizing the public's varied media diet, many outlets have struggled to identify and stick to a specific market or target audience, instead throwing everything at their readers. This not only fails to develop loyal followers, but undermines a media outlet's credibility.

-   Even a cursory glance at the front pages of Kenya's leading newspapers, the Daily Nation and the Standard, suggests both their strategy and their struggle to acquire and maintain an audience.

-   Headlines like XXXX and XXX exist together on the front pages. To place tabloid headlines next to serious headlines, while it may serve to entertain, hurts the credibility of these organizations to be a check on government accountability.

○ As one respondent told us, traditional media is "trying to be everything to everybody."

At its core, this is about understanding the audience. There seems to be a gap between what our urban respondents want in their reporting and what traditional media believes they want. For example, many outlets fail to cover technology news, which young people want.

#### Covering stories to avoid charges of bias

The widespread public perception that media outlets are politically biased because of ownership has influenced newsroom standards in an unusual way: A fear of seeming biased because of political ownership has, counterintuitively, contributed to the perception of bias.

-   Recognizing the public's perception of the media as biased, many outlets will publish critical or negative stories after one outlet covers it.  

-   Ironically, this competition is likely the result of political competition between owners. Because owners are not aligned politically, there is often one outlet willing to publish a critical story, which then the others will be forced to cover to avoid accusations of political bias.

-   Editors seek to "balance" their coverage, especially in political stories, by publishing equal numbers of negative and positive stories about opposing party leaders.

-   The flaw was on full display during the election campaign: If a negative story came out about a candidate, many papers seemed to feel compelled to publish a negative story about the candidate's opponent, in order to avoid accusations of political favoritism. [Example?] The public's reaction to this tactic has been largely critical.  

#### Covering stories that break on social media  

Almost all media respondents noted that breaking news has become the purvey of social media. This is putting notable competitive pressure on traditional media.

-   Social media is surfacing newsworthy events and issues that traditional media might have ignored, forcing media to respond as to why it did not cover certain stories.

-   As a result, it has amplified how political bias and corporate capture have caused media to omit important stories.

{% include flyOut.html title="Case Study: Efforts to Fact Check" content=effortsToFactCheck %}


#### Shifting to digital platforms

-   In response to the citizen trust in social media, many journalists - especially those not on staff at traditional news organizations - have shifted to publishing content through a custom website or blog, as well as social platforms, like Facebook and Youtube.

-   Some of these journalists have been able to build sizable followings.

-   Owaah? Others? Need example of bloggers to cite.

-   Even a number of respondents in the media sector acknowledge the importance of bloggers for their ability to cover stories and issues that they could not cover for many of the reasons described above.

-   While journalists publishing online can still be subject to intimidation, they are free of from the reliance on ad revenue, or ownership, that so oft lead to self censorship

-   There is also positive feedback from citizens, who appreciate individual voices; citizens like the columnists at traditional media, for example, who occasionally provide critical analysis; individual journalists can fill this same role.

-   This is difficult to sustain financially, however.

Innovating digitally

Many outlets are struggling to catch up to the digital age of media. In some cases, digital portals and print editions of the same outlet are competing with each other - example needed.

-   All are still struggling to monetize their digital content. Only one outlet, XXXX, has been able to set up a paywall for content.

-   However, some are showing early success.

-   The Nation has been working to expand its online presence

-   Others, like XXX?, are also incorporating video and interactive storytelling that is only possible online

-   And the pressure of social media is also shifting the kind and style of content newsrooms put out.

-   One editor suggested that he was being forced to publish shorter articles, ostensibly catering to the shortened attention span of his audience

-   Others suggested that since social media has taken over the role of breaking news, that they needed to find news angles to cover stories, and to go deeper, and to provide more context.

[CASE STUDY:]  Examples of digital innovation

The capacity and influence of online sites should not be overstated; relative to traditional media, their reach is small. Yet there are a number of groups that, by freeing themselves from the constraints of the traditional media houses, have come up with digital innovations that hold promise for improving journalistic quality.

-   Africa Uncensored: Responding to a demand for investigative journalism, the newly established outlet aims to reintroduce investigative journalism to Kenya.

-   Kenya's leading media outlets did have investigative units in the past, but these were completely dismantled over XXX amount of time.
