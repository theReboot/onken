### 9. Solidarity Response Networks

### Institutionalizing a “solidarity” network of journalists can increase safety, amplify calls against government intimidation, and support advocacy and legal efforts.

#### Opportunity

One of the most commonly cited strategies amongst respondents facing government intimidation is solidarity---sharing story tips with other journalists, and calling on other journalists to publicly report on antagonism faced by individual members of their community. Donors can build on this existing coping strategy by supporting a membership network, a kind of "NATO for journalists."  

Such a network could play an important role in mitigating journalists' risks, and could embolden them to push harder and dig deeper in their stories---the psychological benefit of knowing that a community of journalists is ready to defend them could help to bolster their independence. By guaranteeing a sustained collective response, the organization could also dissuade government attacks.
