        <p>After decades of total state control of media, campaigns for media reform intensified in the 1990s, effectively softening restrictive and punitive policies, and opening space for a commercialized media and expanded consumer choice.</p>
        <p>Media’s liberalization had mixed effects. For one, local language FM radio stations mushroomed across the country and expanded access to information—playing a pivotal role in political and developmental mobilization efforts at the grassroots.</p>
        <p>But, as media regulations loosened, political interests too took claim of radio frequencies and foreign entertainment flooded in—as it was cheaper than producing locally. Both of which have had long-lasting structural consequences for media ownership and investment in Kenya.</p>

        <p>The Kenya  Information and communication (Amendment) Act 2013 has given the state latitude to control the media landscape. Some of its provisions negate aspects of the 2010 Constitution on press freedom and freedom of the media. Specifically, the KICA law provides for the establishment of regulatory institutions such as the Communications Authority on whose board the state is heavily represented.Among other roles, the CA’s responsibilities include administering the broadcast content aspects of the Act, developing media standards for the broadcasting sector and regulating and monitoring compliance with those standards.</p>
