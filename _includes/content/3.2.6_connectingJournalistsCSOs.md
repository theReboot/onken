### 6. Connecting Journalists and CSOs

### Institutionalizing networks of trust and collaboration between CSOs and journalists can accelerate and amplify the efforts of each.

#### Opportunity

The vital relationships between media and civil society can be opened and strengthened to the benefit of both sectors, and governance at large. Institutionalizing these relationships can encourage more collaboration, and should take many forms. For example, a series of events designed to build networks between the two fields is one strong first step.

#### Impact

This work would increase the impact of both CSOs and journalists. The former would be able to amplify their messages and work, reaching new audiences for advocacy and action, and increasing the pressure they put on government for accountability. Journalists could additionally support CSOs by calling attention to government pressure and threats, thus opening up civic space. For journalists, CSOs can be highly valuable by contributing expertise and information, as well as connections to human interest stories, and can additionally provide security and political cover.
