### 9. Grants for Investigative Journalism

### Providing travel grants and basket funds for investigative journalists can lead to important new accountability stories.

#### Opportunity

Most journalists are now freelancers, underpaid and producing work that is under-published. Donors could establish a system to fund journalists pursuing important investigative stories. Such funding programs exist in other countries, and there are lessons learned to draw from when creating one tailored for Kenya. This opportunity is best paired with a media partnership or one of the distribution platforms, as discussed.

#### Impact

Creating financial incentives for dedicated journalists would help raise the level of professionalism in the field, and potentially raise standards and expectations overall. Ideally, published stories would also spark new audience engagements, although they would not address structural issues of independence.

#### Level of Effort

Creating a new funding stream is relatively minimal effort. The program should focus on addressing one or more specific journalist capacity gaps; for example, many journalists lack issue expertise, as the current media does not enable them to have a "beat;" a funding stream may address this gap by incentivizing journalists to focus on a specific issue area.
