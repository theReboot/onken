### 3. Open New Platforms for Independent Publishing

### Create new spaces for journalists to publish their work, through international media outlet distribution partnerships and/or by funding emerging Kenyan alternative platforms.

#### Opportunity

Journalists need more ways to publish and share their work. Supporters can open these opportunities through international distribution partnerships by fostering the growth of small, innovative media outlets, and potentially even by sparking the creation of new platforms.      

At the organizational level, our research identified only a few small experiments in independent media, namely Thika Town Today, Africa Uncensored, and some individual bloggers. After more in-depth research and evaluation, supporters may choose to encourage these experiments.

They may also choose the international route, working with traditional news sources (such as the BBC and The New York Times) as well as new media companies (like HBO, Netflix, NewsDeeply, and Vice, which are known and used by Kenyan elites) to create fellowships for talented and ethical Kenyan journalists to publish their work. Most ambitiously, supporters could seriously consider fostering the growth and creation of new media platforms at the national level.

Whatever the path, this effort should be driven by ethical, courageous journalists and editors. We suggest convening and opening dialogue among Kenyan media actors as the first step.


#### Impact

Most immediately, these would open new spaces where journalists could publish critical stories that Kenyan media cannot or will not publish. Over the long term, they would provide journalists with opportunities for mentorship (international or local), building their capacity in a holistic way. Journalists could also go on to serve as mentors, entrepreneurs, or other roles with greater reach.
