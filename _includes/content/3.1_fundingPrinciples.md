#### Principles for supporting independent media

Regardless of which discrete recommendations donors pursue, some core principles should be incorporated into the design of all interventions.

**All media development investments must:**

1.  Ensure investments are demand-driven, where Kenyan journalists, editors, and entrepreneurs define the problems, set priorities, and operationalize ideas. Also incentivize problem-driven approaches, using qualitative and quantitative inquiry, user-centered design, and iteration.

2.  Develop and encourage networks to break down silos between disciplines.

3.  Invest for the long-term (ideally 5+ years), as independent media needs time to flourish and diversify funding streams; reliance on a single source of finance creates unnecessary risk.

4.  Define "sustainability" in the context of the deeply political Kenyan media market; sufficient independent commercial revenue sources may be impossible for the foreseeable future.

5.  Encode a system of ethics and quality standards to build trust in establishment media.

6.  Recognize that any "successful" effort may be seen as a threat by the state, and be prepared to adapt accordingly.

7.  Include research into audience demographics and psychographics, and incentivize editors and entrepreneurs to develop a cohesive audience engagement strategy. Â 

8.  Be conscious of deeply entrenched ethnic biases and include efforts to address them.

9.  Strive for gender balance.
