### New Businesses Explore Alternative Channels

Some media innovators and entrepreneurs are using alternative channels and models to reach citizens and engage them in new ways. Their efforts provide a useful starting point for those exploring new models of storytelling:

**Africa Uncensored** is an independent investigative media house. According to its website, it works to "expose wrongdoing by the powerful, and shine a light on the things that truly matter to the people of this continent." Africa Uncensored works with civil society, citizen journalists, and experts to identify stories and develop expertise around a range of issues. Some examples include tribal identity, Kenya's new educational curriculum, and what the Panama Papers exposed about African leaders. It then turns its work over to those who have specialized expertise to drive and sustain public dialogue, and ultimately to bring enough collective pressure on government to enact policy reform. Its editorial team assess the newsworthiness of an issue based not just on the number of people it will impact, but who those people are, with a focus on marginalized groups. For example, Africa Uncensored reporting exposed abuse and extortion by the police of Nairobi's street hawkers, an economically vulnerable group of men and women who sell small wares in and along streets.

**Well Told Story** is another business experimenting with creative approaches to new media. It has a defined target audience (young people, ages 15 to 24), and an explicit mission: to move youth from ignorance to action through creative storytelling on issues of health, money, sex, and agency. A for-profit company, funded by international donors (including Omidyar Network), Well Told Story produces comic books and radio programs. They are invested in spreading their work online---for example, their comic book characters have Facebook pages, and interact with fans online. The organization is also building dialogue between government and youth organizations through live events, bringing local officials to play games, through role-play and other interactive methods, with youth on issues they care about.
