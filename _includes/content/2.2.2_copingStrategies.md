### How media copes

In response to political pressure, media organizations opt between the risk-mitigating strategy of self-censorship or directly confronting government interference. The latter path---resisting government pressure to publish stories that hold the powerful to account---runs serious risks. Despite this, some have been testing new tactics to protect themselves, while ensuring critical coverage reaches the citizens who need it.

Journalists have been experimenting with approaches to temper risks to their career or wellbeing. Solidarity has emerged as an important strategy. An establishment media columnist explained, "media needs to create strong solidarity networks. Politicians are very good at isolating and attacking media houses." Staff reporters, editors, freelancers, and correspondents counter by organizing collective opposition to government efforts to stifle freedom of the press. This includes speaking out together when the government targets individual journalists or media houses, and sharing tactics for political pressure. For example, one tactic for bringing critical coverage to the public is to have journalists pass along promising leads to a colleague to make a story public if they themselves feel unable to publish it. They may also circulate leads to many journalists, encouraging widespread coverage of an issue and making it difficult to retaliate against a single journalist in response---a practice one respondent described as "spreading the risk".

An illustrative case is the coverage of two massive corruption scandals that demonstrate the importance of widespread coverage of sensitive issues to force government action: the National Youth Service (NYS) scandal in 2015 and the Afya House (Ministry of Health) scandal in 2016. In the former, close to USD 2 million was lost through a scheme that involved misuse, diversion, and siphoning of public funds related to the NYS. As a result of the scandal, Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in charge of the Ministry of Devolution and Planning, which oversees the NYS, was forced to step down. (She later contested and won the governorship of Kirinyaga County in August 2017.) In the Afya House scandal, close to USD 5 million went unaccounted for after an internal leak showed massive theft of public funds. As a result of the scandal, 30 health officials were "[re-deployed](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/economy/Afya-House-deploys-top-officers-after-Sh5bn-scam/3946234-4131282-awf78r/index.html)."

Both scandals involved individuals close to Kenya's top political leadership. Given the sensitivities, media reporting was, in some cases, over cautious. Some respondents, particularly in regards to the NYS scandal, felt the media had failed to maintain sustained pressure. At the same time, in both cases, the government felt compelled to take public action in response to the negative publicity it was receiving.

Efforts at creating solidarity networks to challenge political interference exist to some degree. Journalists are, for example, represented by several different organizations---the Kenyan Union of Journalists, the Kenyan Correspondents Association, the Association for Freelance Journalists, the Association of Media Women in Kenya, and the Bloggers Association of Kenya---with varying degrees of success. In addition, there are initiatives such as the Kenya Media Sector Working Group, a coalition of like-minded civil society organizations with an interest in media and press freedom, convened by UNESCO Kenya.

The Kenya Editors Guild (KEG) has also, in recent times, become vocal in cases where the state has threatened the journalists' right to report. Recently, KEG put out a [strongly worded statement](https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018/01/30/editors-guild-alarmed-by-state-house-secret-orders-to-media_c1705824) in response to the government's threat to punish journalists and media houses that covered NASA leader Raila Odinga's mock swearing-in ceremony in January 2018. The statement---signed by KEG Chair Linus Kaikai, a senior editor at the Nation---apparently upset the state. In the days that followed, police blocked The Nation Media Group's entrance for two days, seeking to arrest Kaikai and two other journalists. A Kenyan court then [issued an order](https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Court-extends-no-arrest-order-NTV-journalists/1056-4297130-89nio1/index.html) barring police from arresting them.

Despite the existence of these efforts, many respondents noted that these networks could be strengthened.

Journalists are also experimenting with ways to hold government to account for its attacks on the press. Some respondents shared stories of successfully subjecting government to widespread public criticism. Journalists who have been threatened by political actors will sometimes respond publicly to those efforts by naming the individuals who are issuing threats. In doing so, journalists can draw public support, and rally other journalists in solidarity. A former managing editor explains, "There has always been a danger to journalists. Good journalists are aware of the risks and don't care. But if you are in danger, you need to spread the word to slow the government's momentum. Make it public, name and shame, don't pull punches." A recent report by Human Rights Watch and Article 19, "[Not Worth the Risk: Threats to Free Expression Ahead of Kenya's 2017 Elections](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/30/not-worth-risk/threats-free-expression-ahead-kenyas-2017-elections)," is one example of an effort to draw attention to the risks journalists face, and to those that threaten them.

On the other hand, many newsrooms have adopted a culture of self-censorship, softening their coverage or avoiding topics that could draw the negative attention of political interests. Many engage in shallow reporting, often simply repeating the official government line in an effort to protect themselves. As one establishment reporter explained, "Journalists need to calibrate, to be more cautious. There is an unwritten rule that they need to know all the interests in a story and weigh those interests carefully when deciding to report." A respondent with The Standard noted that while the Moi family, which owns the Standard Media Group, rarely gives explicit direction to editorial staff, they frequently censor themselves over issues perceived as upsetting ownership. For example, he cited sensitivities covering the candidacy of Gladys Boss Shollei, the wife of then Standard Media Group CEO Sam Shollei, for women's representative in Uasin Gishu County. Failing to self-censor, on the other hand, can lead to retribution. One journalist recalled that he was let go over after reporting on alleged corruption within the National Youth Service.

Government pressure combined with low pay among journalists, particularly correspondents and freelancers, has also created perverse incentives for "pay-to-play" journalism. A journalist or editor might receive a one-time or regular payment in return for favorable coverage. Some journalists are even on retainer by politicians, the state, and political parties to ensure positive press. One civil society respondent noted, "The government strategy is to co-opt journalists. The president has had [many] campaign stops but has not allowed local journalists to cover his campaign events. Instead it is his 'press corps' who are paid to cover his campaign favorably. Local journalists try to cover them but end up just parroting what he says. They will also go as far as to self-censor, and to give preferential coverage in the hopes of being favored next time to secure access."

A [study](http://www.mediacouncil.or.ke/en/mck/jdownloads/MEDIA%20MONITORING%20REPORTS/The%20Gender%20Agender.pdf) by the Media Council of Kenya found that, "83 percent of the journalists interviewed noted there is rampant favoritism among editors in selecting stories to be published." "Editors," the study goes on to say, "are most likely to air political stories that come with brown envelopes."
