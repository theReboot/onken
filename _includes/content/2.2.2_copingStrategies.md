### How media responds (coping strategies)

Cumulatively, through an appetite for news and information and especially through a passion for social media, citizens in Kenya today are putting pressure on the media industry to innovate and improve its work.

#### "Trying to be everything to everyone" (negative outcome)

Recognizing that the public consumes a wide variety of media, many establishment outlets have struggled to identify and stick to a specific market or target audience. Instead, as one respondent told us, establishment media is "trying to be everything to everybody."

This not only fails to develop loyal followers, but undermines a media outlet's credibility, as salacious scandal-driven coverage appears alongside serious information in the public interest. Even a cursory glance at the front pages of Kenya's leading newspapers, the Daily Nation and the Standard, suggests both their strategy and their struggle to acquire and maintain an audience. When headlines like  XXXX and XXX exist together on the front pages, it hurts the credibility of these organizations to be a check on government accountability.

At its core, this is about media failing to understand the audience. There seems to be a gap between what our urban respondents want in their reporting and what traditional media believes they want. A group of students interviewed were frustrated with media's failing to cover topics they were interested in such as technology and innovation---saying that traditional media houses just assumed that young people want tabloids and gossip.

#### Covering stories to avoid charges of bias (negative action)

The widespread public perception that media outlets are politically biased because of ownership has influenced newsroom standards in an unusual way: A fear of seeming biased because of political ownership has, counterintuitively, contributed to the perception of bias.Recognizing the public's perception, many establishment outlets will publish critical or negative stories after another outlet covers it. Ironically, this competition is likely the result of political competition between owners. Because owners are not aligned politically, one is sometimes willing to publish a critical story, which then the others will be forced to cover to avoid accusations of political bias.

However, this does not lead to true coverage of important issues. Editors seek to "balance" their coverage, especially in political stories, by publishing equal numbers of negative and positive stories about opposing party leaders. This of course must be balanced with the need to avoid overly negative coverage of people and issues with which ownership has a vested interest.

The flaw was on full display during the election campaign: If a negative story came out about a candidate, many papers seemed to feel compelled to publish a negative story about the candidate's opponent, in order to avoid accusations of political favoritism. [Example?] The public's reaction to this tactic has been at best cynical and largely critical.  

#### Covering stories that break on social media  (positive action)

Almost all media respondents noted that breaking news has become the purvey of social media. This is putting notable competitive pressure on traditional media.

-   Social media is surfacing newsworthy events and issues that traditional media might have ignored, forcing media to respond as to why it did not cover certain stories.

-   As a result, it has amplified how political bias and corporate capture have caused media to omit important stories.

#### Shifting to digital platforms

-   In response to the citizen trust in social media, many journalists - especially those not on staff at traditional news organizations - have shifted to publishing content through a custom website or blog, as well as social platforms, like Facebook and Youtube.

-   Some of these journalists have been able to build sizable followings.

-   Owaah? Others? Need example of bloggers to cite.

-   Even a number of respondents in the media sector acknowledge the importance of bloggers for their ability to cover stories and issues that they could not cover for many of the reasons described above.

-   While journalists publishing online can still be subject to intimidation, they are free of from the reliance on ad revenue, or ownership, that so oft lead to self censorship

-   There is also positive feedback from citizens, who appreciate individual voices; citizens like the columnists at traditional media, for example, who occasionally provide critical analysis; individual journalists can fill this same role.

-   This is difficult to sustain financially, however.

Innovating digitally

Many outlets are struggling to catch up to the digital age of media. In some cases, digital portals and print editions of the same outlet are competing with each other - example needed.

-   All are still struggling to monetize their digital content. Only one outlet, XXXX, has been able to set up a paywall for content.

-   However, some are showing early success.

-   The Nation has been working to expand its online presence

-   Others, like XXX?, are also incorporating video and interactive storytelling that is only possible online

-   And the pressure of social media is also shifting the kind and style of content newsrooms put out.

-   One editor suggested that he was being forced to publish shorter articles, ostensibly catering to the shortened attention span of his audience

-   Others suggested that since social media has taken over the role of breaking news, that they needed to find news angles to cover stories, and to go deeper, and to provide more context.
