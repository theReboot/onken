### 6. Local Distribution Partnerships

Fostering distribution partnerships with localized regional media houses can open new outlets for independent media producers to publish critical content.

#### Opportunity

Local media houses and radio stations are growing quickly and are in need of content. As they already have the business side and mechanics of distribution in place, they can be valuable new partners for journalists who lack entrepreneurial support for critical content. These partnerships will also benefit from collaboration with civil society organizations. Donors may provide seed money for regional media entities to support their larger businesses, as well as financial support for content directly.

#### Impact

While there are few local media outlets not affiliated with or owned by the major establishment media houses, it will be worth investigating potential options, as the local supply-and-demand of regional content will be necessary to build an alternative media in Kenya. Additionally, such distribution partnerships will be necessary to support other initiatives, including grants for investigative journalism (which will need distribution once finished).   

#### Level of Effort

Additional research is needed to explore existing opportunities with regional media distributors. Forming partnerships and building consistent pipelines will take time and effort, especially as donors will need to be careful when navigating regional media's political ties.
