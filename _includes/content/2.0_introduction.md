# The Accountability Ecosystem in Kenya Today

{% include figure.html class="floatLeft" src="/assets/img/on_graphic_intro.png" %}

Understanding the current Kenyan media landscape requires looking at each of the main constituents that interact with the media and affect its public interest work: **Government**, **Citizens**, and **Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)**. Interactions between the media and these constituents create "**pressures and incentives**," which influence the media's ability and willingness to provide independent, unbiased information of public interest. This report analyzes these pressures, as well as media's responses, in order to understand how different factors are influencing the kind of robust, critical, and strategic journalism that drives accountability.

In the first section, we take a high-level view of the **Media** itself. We then explore the constraints created by the other three constituents---**Government**, **Citizens**, and **CSOs**---in more detail.

In each section, we look first at the pressures and incentives that the constituents exert on media, and then at the media's responses, the effects of which we visually assess through Â a Free and Fair Index.
