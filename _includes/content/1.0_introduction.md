# Why Fund Kenyan Media?

-   The Kenyan media has a stellar reputation in the international community. Often hailed as a "success story" of Africa, the country's press is so highly acclaimed that a number of international donors have rapidly decreased their media investments in the country.

-   This has been a huge mistake. The view from abroad is rosy; the view from the ground is frighteningly bleak. The press has faced intense pressure from the Kenyatta administration since 2013.

-   The collapse of the media was on full display this past summer, in the lead-up to the August 8th presidential election. Our team was conducting field research in Nairobi. o   Campaigns, politicians, and platforms dominated the headlines, as they should during these critical events. Kenyans need a independent media to make informed choices at the ballot box. However, where we had hoped to find objective coverage and public scrutiny, we found superficial and biased reporting. [Example here: Would love a story from research?] Perhaps more insidious were the headlines we could not find, intentionally omitted because of political intimidation or bias in the media.

-   The international donor community has withdrawn support at a crucially bad time. Even as we saw a clear need to strengthen the ability of Kenya's media to provide unbiased elections coverage (as just one example of need), we heard frequently about the decline in donor support for media development. Programs have been downsized or closed altogether and staff laid off; capacity development initiatives have reportedly dried up. There is no widespread consensus about why this happened, but respondents were willing to speculate: Â 

-   Donor misconception that Kenya's media is strong and vibrant.

-   Donor concerns about corruption, which is driving away donors. USAID's recent suspension of XXX dollars in funding to the ministry of health over corruption allegations validates this concern.

-   We know that restructuring at Ford Foundation, which had been a major funder of independent media in Kenya was frequently cited.

-   In the context of the lack of donor support, Kenyatta's initial victory in the August election was extremely bad news for the press. The Kenyatta administration has shown clearly that it does not want freedom of press, and has assaulted this institution in intentional and strategic ways, a multi-pronged attack that includes pulling ad revenue, corrupt practices, and attacks on journalists.

-   In calling for an election rerun in October, Kenya's Supreme Court has opened the possibility that a new administration will take office - hopefully peacefully - and create new opportunities for advocacy and action that reaffirms the strength of the freedom of the press.

-   Yet no matter what happens in October, a negative precedent has been set. The government has offered a blueprint for state capture of a free press. And this blueprint has been especially successful because of longstanding and deeply intertwined economic and political weaknesses in the media: Shallow, low-quality reporting and self-censorship has become the norm, and corrupt practices are not rare; political ownership and influence of the media has eroded audience trust, who rely on multiple sources for their information, including social media.

-   The bottom line is that the "vibrant" Kenyan media is a myth. Much of the ground won has been lost; there is an urgent need for donors to step in---as well as urgent opportunities to go beyond the traditional funding models with holistic, integrated, in-it-for-the-long-haul approaches.

-   Securing a free, fair and credible media requires addressing, first and foremost, structural pressures that incentivize bias and self-censorship. Issues like government intimidation and political-biased media ownership subsume issues like capacity and quality of reporting, which are critical but must be considered within this larger context.

-   For Kenya to have the media it deserves, a holistic and coordinated approach is required. It will also necessitate new types of commitments by donors, moving from short term program-based support to long-term core funding.

-   This report offers a roadmap for how.
