### Social media as a tool to control public messaging

The government has become adept at using social media--- enabling it to circumvent media and reach citizens directly, to self-promote, and to manipulate perceptions. Reportedly, the Jubilee administration has proudly called itself a "digital government," and uses that expertise to influence public opinion. It was widely reported that the Jubilee campaign employed Cambridge Analytica, the controversial data and analytics firm that supported both the Trump campaign and the pro-Brexit campaign. While we can't know the exact role this firm played, its involvement illustrates the current government's efforts to control the digital communications space. This approach has been highlighted further by Communications Authority rules around the [dissemination of hate speech](https://www.theelephant.info/uploads/2017/10/CAK-and-NCIC-Joint-Statement-on-User-Generated-Content-on-Social-Media-Platforms-During-the-Electioneering-Period.pdf), which critics argue are too broad and "[open to abuse](http://www.dw.com/en/kenya-warns-of-social-media-crackdown-ahead-of-polls/a-39783282)." A number of respondents also reported that bloggers were paid to produce favorable content, to spread rumors, and to "troll" adversaries (through online harassment), an increasingly common tactic globally.

However, on the whole, social media has been a positive force, providing new channels for Kenyans to express themselves, publicly pressure the government, and disseminate information not picked up by the establishment media. In the coming years, the extent to which more Kenyans (especially in rural areas) are able to access to the internet will influence continued media innovation.
