### 8. Solidarity Response Networks

### Institutionalizing a "solidarity" network of journalists can increase safety, amplify calls against government intimidation, and support advocacy and legal efforts.

#### Opportunity

One of the most commonly cited strategies amongst respondents facing government intimidation is solidarity---sharing story tips with other journalists, and calling on other journalists to publicly report on antagonism. Facing enough outrage, the government has backed down in the past. Donors can build on this existing coping strategy by supporting a membership network, a kind of "NATO for journalists." Â 

#### Impact

Such an organization could play an important role in mitigating journalists' risks, and could embolden them to push harder and dig deeper in their stories---the psychological benefit of knowing that a community of journalists is ready to back them up could be huge. By guaranteeing a sustained collective response, the organization could also dissuade government attacks. Such an organization would integrate well with other initiatives described in this report, and would amplify those efforts.
