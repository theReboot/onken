The structural challenges that characterize the media landscape---government influence and intimidation, self-censorship, lack of solidarity among journalists and civil society, limited alternative publishing platforms, and low capacity---have severely weakened the media's ability to consistently deliver high quality, sustained, and critical coverage.

All of these are either built on existing positive coping strategies or intended to correct negative coping strategies. They are interconnected, and each will influence multiple constituents in the ecosystem.
