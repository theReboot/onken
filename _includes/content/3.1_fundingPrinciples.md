### Across-the-board Funding Principles

Regardless of what is funded, there are certain core principles across the board - all programs should take these into consideration:   

-   Support gender balance

-   Work for tribal balance

-   Support must be in it for the long-haul

-   A single donor isn't enough (re: Ford Foundation pulled out)

-   Support must seek to encourage networks (break down siloes, bring multiple groups together)

-   "Sustainability" needs to be defined in a way that respects the negative impact commercial interests have had a media independencemay be impossible
