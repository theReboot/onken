### How media responds (coping strategies)

Despite the few positive instances described above, the vast majority of CSOs lack strong media relationships, especially professionally; personal relationships seem to be the main open channel. Journalists therefore do not currently experience much pressure from CSOs (and perceive few incentives for working with them); the influence of the other constituents, government and citizens, is much more powerful. However, where media do respond to CSOs, some of their coping strategies are positive.

As much as CSOs mistrust journalists, journalists mistrust CSOs. Media respondents told us frequently that most CSOs are just seeking free publicity, and that they fail to understand what is "newsworthy," and therefore don't provide journalists with worthwhile information. There are also some perceptions that CSOs are catering to international donors at the expense of public interest. One journalist described the experience of meeting a CSO to do a human interest story, only to be fed a predetermined promotional story.

When media and CSOs are able to overcome this mistrust, personal networks (as opposed to institutional relationships) seem to be the primary source of interaction. Journalists will often respond, and even report on, CSO work based on a personal request, but respondents made a point to emphasize that these were the exception. One respondent, highlighting the importance of personal connections, told us that his CSO employs a number of former journalists: "We work with a selection of key journalists that we knew from when most of us were journalists ourselves. This helps with our advocacy."
