### How civil society pressures and incentivizes media

CSOs are well aware of the need to have productive relationships with media. They need these relationships to draw the public's attention to the issues they work on. They also need these relationships to ensure that these issues are presented accurately in the press. However, considering the current divide between CSOs and media cited by several respondents, to realize the potential of these relationships, CSOs need a greater understanding of how media works and how to engage them.

When Kenyan CSOs and media cooperate, they both benefit. One journalist called NGOs and CSOs "great links to story ideas." Another respondent who participated in a civil society-facilitated gender training described it as transformational. This training successfully sparked debate, helping important gender issues resonate with the (largely male) audience by encouraging them to relate the topic to their own female family members. To this particular respondent, civil society trainings must be personal and compelling. When they are, she went on to say, they can transform the way journalists think about and cover social issues.

Another CSO respondent described the story of a health facility, which was put at risk due to a "land grab" by government officials. Within a few hours of hearing the news, the CSO organized a demonstration via WhatsApp with hospital patients. They simultaneously organized a press briefing in Nairobi for media. This successfully drew the attention of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, and within three weeks, the land was returned to the health facility.

On the other hand, CSOs and media need to overcome mutual mistrust. According to a former Standard journalist, now working in civil society, "Media holds the view that CSOs cannot be trusted. CSOs think media is weak and influenced." The sectors primarily interact with each other through personal connections rather than institutional relationships.

Outside of personal connections, CSOs and journalists relationships are weak at best. This mistrust seems to be driven by frustration among CSOs that media appear uninterested in covering issues CSOs work on, and on the other side, that CSOs fail to make their issues compelling and newsworthy. Researchers also heard concerns from CSOs about the need to pay for coverage. One CSO respondent noted that "Media always want sensational stories, and think the development issues can wait until tomorrow." A sympathetic civil society respondent acknowledge that his peers needed to take greater responsibility in getting their issues into the media saying "CSOs complain about media, but their events are not newsworthy. CSOs need to prove [our issues] are newsworthy." Overall, limited understanding of each sector by the other seems to underpin the trust issues that have hurt cooperation. Improving communication and understanding between CSOs and journalists, including developing CSOs' media outreach capacity, could help to begin bridging some of these gaps and establishing stronger, more productive relationships.
