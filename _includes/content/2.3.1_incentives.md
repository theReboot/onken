### How civil society pressures and incentives media

The large gap between CSOs and media in Kenya is troubling. While CSOs are well aware of the need for media coverage to further their goals, we found very few examples of organizations exerting influence or pressure on the media in any way. This is due to limited capacity as well as a deep divide of mistrust, which a number of respondents noted.

#### Mistrust for journalists

CSOs often describe media as "lazy," as well as corrupt. They perceive that journalists, accustomed to government bribes, will often ask for payment in exchange for coverage. CSOs who see themselves as mission-driven are often frustrated when they interact with journalists who seem to have other priorities; one CSO respondent noted that "media always want sensational stories, and think the development issues can wait until tomorrow." He discussed his experience with developing a regional TV show focused on budget issues, which was canceled without explanation (but likely for political reasons). Bad experiences with journalists, especially at establishment media organizations, have convinced some CSOs that engagement is not worth the effort.

#### Pulling political strings

Some CSOs have found that working with politicians helps secure media attention---if a politician shows up at an event, the media is more likely to show up, too. One health advocacy organization explained that they have been closely monitoring the elections, so that they can quickly engage with the newly elected officials to get them "on board" with their work: "If we get in new leaders, we need to sensitize them on the priorities---working with Budget Committee, Health Committee, New Council of Governors---so the strategy changes with who comes into power."  

#### Facilitating human interest content for journalists

Some CSOs have had success with attracting media attention through the stories of their work. One freelance journalist said called NGOS and CSOs "great links to story ideas." Other CSOs discussed partnering with the Media Council of Kenya to host issue-specific trainings for journalists; one respondent worked on a training on gender in Mombasa, which he described as not only entertaining for journalists, but transformational for their ways of thinking. The training successfully sparked debate, and encouraged men to relate the topic of gender to their own female family members.

#### Building journalists' capacity

CSOs that focus directly on freedom of the press are, obviously, the most closely aligned---including Human Rights Watch, Article 19, and the Kenyan Correspondents Association. Their support for media has unfortunately declined in recent years, in tandem with the general decline of funding for both media development and civil society initiatives. For example, Internews and HIVOS had established "media development centers," where journalists could have access to workspace, a computer, internet, and mentorship. These centers also tried offering space for CSOs, too, and one respondent told us about joining monthly roundtables to discuss issues with journalists; however, the pilot was unsuccessful, due to the aforementioned issues of trust. Many of the centers have since closed, and on the whole they are used only by a small number of well-connected journalists, mostly in Nairobi.
