### 5. Grants for Investigative Journalism

### Providing travel grants and reporting funds for journalists can help support investigative journalism.

#### Opportunity

Most journalists are now freelancers, underpaid and producing work that struggles to get published. To increase their potential, donors could establish a system to fund journalists pursuing important investigative stories. Such funding programs exist in other countries, such as the [Pulitzer Center's travel grants](https://pulitzercenter.org/grants), that offer lessons for such initiatives tailored for Kenya. This opportunity is best paired with an effort to strengthen journalist relationships with international publishers or support for independent publishing platforms to ensure that when strong investigative pieces are produced, there are avenues willing and ready to publish them. Special attention could be paid to awarding grants to women journalists, or to those journalists working in typically marginalized parts of the country.
