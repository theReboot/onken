### Citizens Advocate for Their Town

A medium-sized town outside of Nairobi, Thika attracts little media attention. A citizen-run blog, [Thika Town Today](http://www.thikatowntoday.co.ke/), was founded to fill this gap; despite capacity constraints, the blog is beginning to open new lines of effective communication from citizens to their government.

Founded by one citizen, and now with a staff of two, the blog covers local news, including issues with governance and service delivery, and describes its mission as "serving the people." Its website lists "No inclination to any race, tribe, religion, or political affiliation" as one of its core values.

Despite some struggles to access government officials, researchers heard that the outlet is beginning to create a positive feedback loop for local citizens. For example, people report certain issues to Thika Town Today, which publishes the story. This makes people feel heard, making citizens feel they have greater power in relation to their government. Thika Town Today's success suggests that local-level media efforts are ripe for experimentation and investment.
