### How media responds (coping strategies)

Despite the instances described above, the vast majority of CSOs are divided from media relationships, especially professionally; personal relationships seem to be the only open channel. Journalists therefore do not currently experience much pressure from CSOs (and perceive few incentives for working with them); the influence of the other constituents, government and citizens, is much more powerful. However, where media do respond to CSOs, their coping strategies are largely more positive; donors must understand the current interactions between these potential vital allies.

#### Mistrust for CSOs

As much as CSOs mistrust journalists, the feeling is mutual. Media respondents told us frequently that most CSOs are just seeking free publicity, and that they fail to understand what is "newsworthy," and therefore don't provide journalists with worthwhile information. There are also some perceptions that CSOs are catering to international donors at the expense of public interest. Within this mistrust, personal networks seem to be the primary source of interaction. Journalists will often respond, and even report on, CSO work based on a personal request, but respondents made a point to emphasize that these were the exception. One respondent told us that his CSO employs a number of former journalists: "We work with a selection of key journalists that we knew from when most of us were journalists ourselves, this helps with our advocacy."

When journalists have positive interactions with CSOs, they value the relationship, and will work with them on complex topics. An example?
